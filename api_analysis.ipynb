      "review_3: Food was outstanding, service was relaxed but good. Their beef noodle soup, wagyu, and uni were the highlights, but everything else we tried was excellent too.There was an event taking place that evening. Made it a bit livelier but didn’t interfere with our dinner. (END OF REVIEW)\n",
      "review_4: waited for 15 minutes in an empty restaurant and other than water no-one showed up. Food choices seemed very limited. waited 10 more minutes and walked out. No apologies, no words of how can we do better. I understand these are tough times, but having a restaurant in an expensive neighborhood, least you can do is have some service (END OF REVIEW)\n",

      "review_6: There’s no sign outside so you have to look for the restaurant. The food was fantastic but the ambiance is weird. It didn’t feel like a restaurant. It felt like just a bar. It feels mediocre for the price but I’d say food was great… (END OF REVIEW)\n",
      "review_7: Yum yum yum. Innovative dishes with really thoughtful and unique combinations of spices, textures, and ingredients. Drinks are awesome too! (END OF REVIEW)\n",
      "review_8: There are so many places in San Francisco to spend too much money for okay food. This is not that. This is a thoughtful omakase menu by a wonderful chef who has poured her soul into each dish. A mix of uniqueness, fantastic taste, and love. We felt so privileged to get to experience this—on our list, it will be one of those few places that we discovered before everyone else did. We will be back, and will be telling our friends!

      "review_11: The food and Japanese whiskey flights were incredible. The service was outstanding. It was perfect for our birthday celebration. Highly recommend. It's a small menu and each dish was outstanding. (END OF REVIEW)\n",
      "review_12: Food is amazing.  Try the uni dishes or the beef noodle soup! (END OF REVIEW)\n",
      "review_13: I looked for a unique dining experience to entertain business guests in SF this week and I found a gem with 5A5!!! I let the excellent Cheif Cat select and have us served family style and WHAT A CULINARY TREAT!!! From Starters to Entrees, nothing disappointed. Her last Entree was the Beef and Noodles, which all of us raved about - really an exceptional dish.If you want to skip the traditional Steak Houses of SF for a unique culinary experience, it’s 5A5!!

      "review_23: Intimate but fun, lively setting with a mix of diners and happy hour guests. Short rib beef noodle soup was delish, a5 wagyu skewers were a fav too. Chicken wings/wangs were a bit messy but great crunch/texture. Reasonably priced for the quality (END OF REVIEW)\n",
      "review_24: Delicious and cute with highly attentive service. The entrance is a bit hard to see but worth the hunt. The beef soup is the highlight if you want something hearty but all the bite were delicious. We ordered almost everything between two people and a Japanese whisky flight. Shrimp toast was more delicious then it had any right to be. Wagu dumpling with it's rich broth was also surprisingly exceptional. Salmon collar was also decent portion and so fatty and flavorful. The melon salad with the salmon in a fish sauce dressing should be it's own dish. I'll be back. (END OF REVIEW)\n",
      "review_25: The two cocktails I has were amazing (Black & Gold + Forget Me Not), but the Change Your Life bowl did not live up to the name and the shrimp and uni toast was also underwhelming (END OF REVIEW)\n",

      "review_27: The food is extremely salty for me as a Taiwanese living in the US for about 7 years. Service is good. Noted that the restaurant charges an 18% service fee on top of the tips, which, together with the item price, makes the experience over-priced. I would try other fine dining options which would not lead to having to drink five glasses of water in an hour. The taste of standard Asian restaurants is also more of the taste of my liking. (END OF REVIEW)\n",
      "review_28: Fantastic meal, great selection of different small plates for us to try. A5 Wagyu skewers and beef noodle soup were our favs. QR code ordering/payment was easy and efficient. (END OF REVIEW)\n",
