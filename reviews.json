The beef soup is the highlight if you want something hearty but all the bite were delicious. We ordered almost everything between two people and a Japanese whisky flight. Shrimp toast was more delicious then it had any right to be. Wagu dumpling with it's rich broth was also surprisingly exceptional. Salmon collar was also decent portion and so fatty and flavorful. The melon salad with the salmon in a fish sauce dressing should be it's own dish. I'll be back."

Noted that the restaurant charges an 18% service fee on top of the tips, which, together with the item price, makes the experience over-priced. I would try other fine dining options which would not lead to having to drink five glasses of water in an hour. The taste of standard Asian restaurants is also more of the taste of my liking."

We did change our table to one over. If you are seated by the kitchen it is a little uncomfortable bc your chair will be just a tad out of the walk way and the noise from the kitchen is a distraction to your conversation. Outside of that my date for the evening ordered the lobster tail which he has decided to never eat at another restaurant it was so good, and 32ounce Ribeye with loaded mashed potatoes. His steak was cooked to perfectly medium and was very tender.I ordered a Pear Watercress salad which was fairly good and the Where is the Beef? option since I am vegetarian. Of course with any steak house you should be there to eat steak but I just cant lol. The risotto wasn\u2019t cooked all the way through so there were some moments where it was hard, the lentils were dry however the carrots, zucchini and squash were all amazing. (which wasn\u2019t much).If we should ever go again I would just order the side dishes and would be satisfied with that.All in all it was a very nice night and my date enjoyed his dinner and we together enjoyed the atmosphere and service."

Also, the gnome steak was covered with sweet sauce and fries egg. Why do they need fried egg on the top of the good meat??! I have eaten at Benjamin New York, Peter Rugar and they have never disappointed me with the quality of the meat.  Do not go for T bone steak"

We tried a t bone and bone in rib eye and Mac and cheese. The meats were good but not especially flavorful.  Hubby can cook and season a piece of quality steak at home with better result. The Mac and Cheese was good, horribly rich. You can taste the cheeses, cream and truffle. Waiter was nice and we got to sample their 2 kinds of bread and 2 complimentary amuse bouche. We sat in the back where a large table was celebrating a birthday.  Bit the birthday boy was loud and obnoxious.  Not planning to come back."

They didn't have it in stock, so I moved to Macallan. Appetizers were good (we got the fried Shishito peppers and wagyu sliders). Steaks are nice quality and there medium (That's what I usually order) is pretty nice and tender inside. So, happy about it. The 7 deg Coffee desert was a nice portion and would be good for 3.to share :)Overall a great experience. Staff is very attentive."

It was my birthday so they could have told I would get  a complimentary dessert but they didn't. It came after we ordered and ate dessert. My daughter called the restaurant and ordered 4 after dinner drinks to surprise us. They never came. She was not charged but it ruined a nice surprise. We will not return. Too many other place we like that serve good food, have great service and are less expensive."

Salads are very small, the ribeye was flavorless and the bacon in the mashed potatoes was incredibly chewy. Unfortunately the last visit was my last. They push the kobe beef, which is insanely expensive and even with no wine dinner for 2 was north of $250 - kinda silly for bad food and sharing of app, salad and steak."

The add-on sides, too, are very good. We had mashed potatoes and mac-n-cheese... granted they were yummy, as they should be for almost $20 a serving.  The steak - my wife never tried Waygu before, and since we also had a gift certificate, she wanted to try it. Luckily the gift card covered her $170 4-ounce Waygu ribeye steak. They do talk it up, saying that the cows are played classical music, are massaged daily, have Tolstoy read to them... and sure it melts like butter in your mouth, but roughly 4 bites at $40+ a bite later... it still ends up in the same place as the $20 potato and the $20 mac and cheese. Don't get me wrong... it's an experience to realize you're eating a figurative \"Cash Cow,\" but not one I would spend my hard-earned money on again.   Nice time though. Wish they catered more to children... when we asked for a glass of milk for our daughter, it seemed as if we were putting them out a bit and inconveniencing them. It took probably 20 minutes or so for them to bring it out. The place, though, is not good for kids under say, 12, or those who don't eat \"adult\" food. They do have a \"vegetarian\" meal: beets, carrots and assorted veggies for 25 bucks. At that price, though... best to just stick with the 15 dollar truffle fries."

I\u2019ve heard others give mix reviews about 5A5 because of the service but I always thought those experiences were flukes, but this last time we went we were finally victims of the bad service everyone was talking about. Our dining experience was awful because of the poor service. We came to celebrate my parents\u2019 35th wedding anniversary and while it was noted in my reservation, not once were my parents greeted. We never got our sparkling water refilled (which, mind you, is $9) and we felt like our server was purposefully ignoring us. He would literally stand about 2 feet from our table and not once glance at us to check in even though we were trying to get his attention. We didn\u2019t do anything wrong, so I don\u2019t know why we got the type of service we did. We even noticed he would revisit a table twice before coming to our table. On the receipt his name was \u201cJohn\u201d - it was unfortunate and we were all really disappointed with our dining experience. They get the two stars because the quality of the meat is superb, but lost their other stars and our dining loyalty due to poor service."

It was our first time there and our server made sure we were taken care of. Rebecca was VERY knowledgeable about the food AND the drinks.  Every recomendation she made, we took and we were never disappointed.  We had the bone marrow, soup du jour, wagyu rib eye, bone-in rib eye and truffle mac and cheese... EVERYTHING WAS DELICIOUS.  We also had the japanese whiskey flight and the love with gin.  We left fully satisfied. I would highly recomend this place.  Food, service, ambience was TOP NOTCH."

We were a young couple and it seem like, he assume we couldn\u2019t afford anything. He check on us once and never filled up our waters. We spent $350, so the food was good but the lack of service and attention by our server was disappointing for the price we paid."

Table was in the middle which was a disappointment, but not a criticism. Our waiter was a bid weird - the guy did not follow the normal sequence of looking after us - no drink requests, no starters, etc. Went straight into the wagyu presentation - all chatty and informative discussion with him. Nevertheless, got our drinks, bone marrow starters and dry aged T-Bones with a side of wagyu rib cap. The flow was good, food excellent, and an overall positive experience. One complaint - the steaks and the plates they came on was presented as \"careful very hot\" - but in fact was quite cool - below expected standards."

Now it's a hot mess.\"The manager had no idea.  He allowed that the service was slow and unorganized and gave lip service about making it up to us. \"I get where you are coming from - but we still don't even have my credit card back.  This is a mess from start to finish.  I couldn't imagine bringing a client here.\"To be fair, the steak was delicious.  So if you like your steak with a side of unpredictability, 5A5 is perfect."

The food was cooked perfectly and melted in our mouths.  We were very disappointed to find our teen aged daughters had to share a large common restroom with men down stairs from the main restaurant.  One would think a fine dining establishment could at least have a separate powder room for their female customers instead of a football stadium style bathroom in a poorly lite basement in which they were forced to share with men."

Little did we know that it was a Japanese steak house specializing in various forms of Wagyu as well as whiskies. After being presented with four of the most marbled steaks I have ever seen, three of us opted for a 32 oz bone in rib eye (American) which was fabulous. We started with an excellent wedge salad as well as heirloom tomatoes and our colleague the vegetarian ordered the entry entitle \u201cwhere\u2019s the beef\u201d which was an array of roasted vegetables. The two sides we ordered were the sweet potato and the button mushrooms, both of which were delicious.The wine list was adequate and relatively reasonable and the service was excellent.I highly recommend this restaurant and we will definitely be back."

The servers were very courteous and provided examples of the different Wagyu beef that they had.  In addition, the presentation was spectacular as seen in the attached pictures.  The server also provided excellent recommendations of drinks to pair with the Wagyu beef. We were so full by the end of the beef, that we had to take home the sides."

The service was good for the most part. My only issue was with the helper bringing our plates out. He spoke very fast explaining what we were having and left very quickly.  Other then that the service was impeccable. Jessica our waitress was AMAZING for the start. She noticed my dates menu was nasty and she brought over a new one that was clear for her to read. Down to her explanation of the wagyu meats. My date was very IMPRESSED and so was I. I definitely would prefer this restaurant to all my friends and family.  Its definitely a great experience."

It was refreshing after a heavy meal of steak.The only down side was the service could have been a bit more attentive.  It took a little while to get the server to take our order after explaining the menu, and then once we get our meal the server hardly came by to refill the water or ask if we need any other items.  Would have been nice if they left the bottle of water on the table.  Then I could have just helped myself to the water since I tend to drink a lot of water."

Went for my girlfriend's birthday and they threw in a birthday dessert and ceviche on the house.  Steaks and sides were both amazing.  Great selection of Japanese and American oriented options from a meat and booze perspective.  Thoughtfully walked through the nuances of Wagyu beef, the processes behind it, and what you're supposed to look for as a consumer.  We loved all of the food and the service was excellent.

The rest sucked. as soon as we (6 of us) sat down the guy asked us what we wanted to drink and then pointed straight at a $300 bottle of wine. Putting the host in the spot. He then brings out flight of Japanese steaks that costs $550 and begins to rave.  Extremely uncomfortable.he didn't feel like a waiter, but he felt like a salesman trying to upsell. I was just there for steak dinner. Instead I felt like I was shamed because I didn't choose what he suggested.  Never felt so ashamed to for choosing $70 steak, $17 fries and $18 a glass wine, and a $20 souffle.  After tax and tip, the bill came out to about $900 after for the 6 of us.  Never felt so small spending so much.  Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me.  Not going back here."

We had been recommended by someone who works for MasterCard and takes his clients here - I had to let him know he might want to think otherwise!! It took 45 minutes to even get our first drink. The birthday boy ordered a martini right when we sat down and that took 25 minutes. We sat before other nearby tables and we saw our waiter constantly at those tables but we literally had to wave our arms to get him over to our table. People had come in and eaten and paid their bill and we were still waiting for our food. Once we got our food though - it was all amazing! Everyone loved their steaks and I had the Chilean sea bass which was so good! The honey shrimp appetizer was delicious as well. They also did some cutr plates with happy birthday on it for the birthday boy! Just too bad about the service as I can\u2019t recommend anyone coming back here. There were 5 of us all in a variety of service industries and we were all taken aback by the lack of service to our table."

Not exotic, but very high quality food. The wine that we had was excellent...   ....the house by the glass.  And I highly recommend the Japanese Whisky flight."

The noise is a little much, many of the booths have seats that face each other, if you get a big mouth near you the noise level can be close to deafening.  Just be prepared for a budget busting, but fantastic experience of wagyu and possible rock concert like noise levels if you are surrounded by loud mouths."

That said, we stuck with the \"regular\" items which we'd hope would be a notch below but still pretty decent. Honestly, the prime rib, NY strip, and ribeye were a bit disappointing. Nothing memorable, and meat wasn't as tender, flavorful and juicy as we expected. We also tried the filet which was probably the best out of all the steak entrees we had.  Sides were very good however - sweet potato gnocchi and mashed potatoes w/maple bacon were standouts. Service that was slow and lackluster. Waiter seemed to be distracted by other tables and more attentive with them. We watched as servers at other tables asked if they'd ever been there, then went on to explain the menu and how it works. We got none of that. Wine glasses stayed empty and food took an unusually long time to come out. All said and done, we liked the ambiance and would be willing to go back to give them another try... with much lower expectations."

The staff remembered me and treated me like a queen. Fast forward a year, visit to San Francisco for the weekend, I returned for dinner with my mother. Ben, one of the servers, REMEMBERED me from a year before!!! He remembered I was with a girl friend and why I was up in SF!! Again, treated like a queen! Thanks for your excellent service, individualized service, yummy food and drinks!!! It became my favorite steak place last year and remains my favorite in San Francisco."

I had the T-Bone and from a discount steak place I\u2019d honestly have found less fat on the fillet and more tender sirloin so really when you are paying probably 2-3 times more here you\u2019d expect more.Maybe their more expensive options are what they want you to go for but if the mid-range menu pieces aren\u2019t a focus then why have them at all let alone at that price. I\u2019d recommend the Cheesecake Factory over this unfortunately.Service, decor and ambience was perfect."

Only reason they don\u2019t get full stars for food was that they served Chinese broccoli with cheese. Fusion I understand, but Asian inspired food with dairy never works...also wasn\u2019t clear from the menu that they would serve it like that. My date (non-Asian) was also taken aback...otherwise a fantastic evening. I didn\u2019t send it back, we just tried our best to eat it"

Then, when we ordered, the server was clearly trying to push the most expensive dishes. She suggested the lobster tempura - it arrived over cooked and the flavor was lackluster. The $80 ribeye we ordered was not seasoned nor was it tender. We ordered it medium rare. Also, they didn\u2019t slice it for us. Typically, when you go to a steakhouse and you order a 32oz bone-in ribeye, they slice it for you. Not the best experience and I will not be returning."

Incredible, first-rate service.TO make a long story short 4 of us shared the Wagyu experience which has 4 pieces (one of each cut of Wagyu) of steak that we shared with 3 sides. They were all incredible. Wagyu is everything you think it can be and more, and my favorite was the rib eye. It's about $38 an oz but worth it for a special occasion."

She mentioned that it is backed by at least 20 mins, so we waited in the bar area. 45 mins went by and we noticed that people that came in after us started getting seated before us. I walked up to the hostess and asked how much longer it would take, i gave my name, she was scrolling through the list and asked \u201cYou checked in with me right?\u201d  I nodded yes, then she continued to scroll through her list. I mentioned i did check in at 7:45 and it was already 8:30. She said please give me a couple of more minutes to get you a table. After that we were then seated. Other than that, the dinning experience was great for a valentines day night."

However, we noticed that the level of service we received was nowhere near the service given to all the tables around us. Our waiter, and other waiters we noticed, were constantly checking in on their guests and seeing what was needed. However, at some point, we did not see our water for almost half an hour. We were not updated on why the food was taking so long to be prepared either. A simple update would have sufficed. The food was great, but for the price I expected much better service."

Ran out of prime rib, but I ordered the bone-in rib eye and it hit the spot...it's HUGE.  Steaks were great, but I think their sides really stand out as well.  We devoured them.  Fun place...Go."

Sorry I can't remember his name, but buyer beware."

I started with the beet salad and my girlfriend had the American wagyu meatballs. When I saw them I knew they were soft and flavorful and they did not disappoint. We brought our own St. Supery Cab. It paired great with the NY strip and the dry-aged T-Bone that I had. The steaks were like butter. Maybe next time we will splurge for the Japanese Waygu. SUPERB!!"

The birthday boys bone-in ribeye was rare as opposed to medium so that was disappointing for him.

Really bizarre choices with respect to sauces and stale/rancid garlic on the prime rib. It appears that 5A5 is using choice rather than prime beef and the filet was dry. The St. Emilion was rougher than most Merlots and not as good as it should have been. Loved the jazz, but it could have been less intrusive (overly loud). Walked into 5A5 with high expectations which weren't at all met. As noted, the kitchen needs a change of staff."

We arrived early to our reservation and they seated us which was amazing since it was around a little bit after prime time hour. After about 5 minutes of waiting we were served water and our waiter comes over and speaks to us about the 5a5 experience. Granted it sounded phenomenal but it was a little pushy, I get it though. After we turned down the 5A5 experience that\u2019s when I noticed that our waiter stopped paying attention to us. After another 8-10 minute wait he decides to come back and take our order. We decided to order the duck soup, scallops, t-bone New York and filet mignon which were all amazing. We typically judge a place by how often they fill our water which I think speaks to how attentive the staff is. We waited with empty glasses and eventually ask for water, this happened two occasions. The restaurant was not busy. Our waiter constantly walked around and made eye contact with us, but never once offered to refill our water unless we waived him down or another staff member. The food itself was very good. As we were getting full we once again were passively waiting for the waiter to come by and check in on us or at least ask us how our meal is going. Stopped by once to check in and not to be seen for another 20 minutes. After we finally get his attention and ask for some boxes and the check he brings out a desert menu for us to look at. When I originally made the reservation I had made a note to ask if they could bring a little dessert out for my girlfriend. Right as we are getting ready to pay (waiting for 15 min for him to grab my credit card) he finally comes to our table with the birthday dessert for my girlfriend. We take our time to eat the dessert, again with empty water glasses. Another 15 min go by after we\u2019ve finished and our server comes back with our check. All in all, food was great, but the lack of attentive service doesn\u2019t make this place worth."

There were several seats open and we were seated at the smallest table in the whole restaurant.  There were other couples enjoying booths and cozying up to one another and being that I made this reservation over a month ago stating it was my hubby's 40th birthday,  I had hoped for better seating.  That aside... our experience was great.  The ambiance is a little loud but it's a beautiful restaurant and very hip.  Lots of young people.  I had read some reviews before coming so we started with the hamachi spoon and the lobster tempura appetizers which were both fantastic! For dinner we each ordered the bone-in rib eye. There is no indication of size on the menu.  This thing was huge!  About 1.5 in thick and had to weigh 24oz. It was more like a tomahawk steak. The waiter did ask us if we were sharing and we said no,  but never mentioned  that it was enough to feed 2-3 people.  That's ok.  I made steak and eggs for breakfast the next day and my 12yr old son was stoked! ...And the steak was delicious!   In the future I think we'll just share. We had the truffle mac and cheese and pesto asparagus as our sides and both were delicious.  I also want to mention 2 times during our meal one of the chefs in the kitchen brought out a little bite appetizer, compliments of the chef.  That was a nice touch.  I had the raspberry cheesecake for dessert and it was great.  My hubby didn't want dessert but they brought him out a beautiful plate with a tiny chocolate cake bite.   Very sweet.  It was a bit on the pricey side but what great restaurant in SF isn't?  [About $400] overall I would definitely recommend coming here for a nice specialoccasion."

I got a kettle one dirty martini, very dirty.  The bartender and waiter both heard me loud and clear because it came exactly as ordered \u201cvery dirty\u201d.  That said, it was served in a champagne glass.  Therefore, not only was the presentation underwhelming (glass not chilled nor was the drink chilled) but the portion was probably the smallest I\u2019ve ever received...at any restaurant.  I almost suggested leaving but read too many great reviews about the food.  Our waitress was excellent as well as the food!

Appetizers of hamachi crudo and lobster tempura were good, the crudo would make much more sense as an amuse bouche. My New York strip wasn\u2019t very good, my husbands bone in ribeye was good. The server totally forgot about us mid-meal and we had to wave someone down to get our check a couple times. Overall the value isn\u2019t there, much better steakhouses abound in SF."

We ordered Ribeye Wagyu and Prime Rib with 1 appetizer and 2 side dishes for the two of us.  The Wagyu was nice,  but not outstanding for the price ($150+). The prime rib was a disappointment as it had a lot of tendon such that I ended up leaving more than half of it on the plate.  For $37, I think I could get better prime rib elsewhere, and yet this is a restaurant known for its beef?  So my conclusion is this may be a nice place to bring business clients, but not so much for a couple having an evening meal.  With 2 drinks, our total bill came out to more than $320 before tip."

The interior was very loungey, the menu obviously with a Japanese bent. Happy hour options valid only in Lounge, we were first sat at the table but was moved to Lounge. Service was decent and we enjoyed the food.We ordered Truffle Fries, Roast Beef Panini w/ Tomato Dashi Bisque, and Baby Back Ribs and they were all great. Beef Panini had a decent amount of beef with the right mixture of Provolone in nice grill-marked paninis. Bisque was rich and tasty. Baby Back Rib had gochujang added to the traditional BBQ sauce and came out as an interesting mix. Even the coleslaw with the rib was one of the best I had ever had. Would like to come back again!"

Great steaks, wonderful and knowledgeable service makes for a memorable dining experience.  They offer three levels of meat quality, including the quintessential A5 wagyu cuts.  Offered is a tasting option of 4 cuts of A5 beef for about 600 bucks.  We ordered this the last time we were here, but not this time.  Had the huge rib eye and a couple of cuts of the NY and filet wagyu this time.  All were phenomenal.  Highly recommend meat lovers come to enjoy the passion of beef."

We had a seat at the bar for a few casual cocktails before our reservation - all staff was friendly and knowledgeable. I had both fish and steak - both of which were melt-in-your-mouth delicious! Good tequila selection and great ambiance. Would recommend 5A5 for a more intimate gathering as it's a tad on the romantic side."

I'll preface the rest of this review by saying I do not mind paying premium prices generally associated with fine dining, but for food to be expensive and waste otherwise amazing produce while providing nothing but disappointment is another thing entirely.2 x cuts of wagyu ruined by poor cooking and unimaginative, disrespectful recipes.1 lobster ruined by throwing it in a discount mac and cheese mix. 1 serve of powdered mash potato and a chicken as dry the Sahara and you've got a perfect recipe for wasting $600.They should not be able to purchase or sell wagyu of any level, the kitchen should not be cooking outside of an outback steakhouse. If I owned or managed this establishment I would be doing a hard reset or working out if a steakhouse was really my wheelhouse. This review is not directed at the front of house."

We then asked to be seated elsewhere, preferably under the beautiful lit up the ceiling, and we were. Pros: decent server, fancy overpriced cocktails, and my company. Cons: fatty filet, no mash potatoes available and a limp Cesar salad. For the price you pay, the ambiance is really all you get. Location and vibes, cool, but the food was mediocre."

When we told him we never received the second side he said order desert it was on him.  Then the check came and he charged us for it.  He was an absolute mess!"

The manager would check on us during our meal to make sure our champagne glasses were filled and that we were doing ok.  In fact the waiter and the manager kept bringing us these tasty bites to eat while were were there.  I remember the fresh chivichi on a chip that was so good I would have ordered that as an appetizer.  If you're in San Francisco I would definitely recommend this restaurant.  Great food and great service."

Only had one night to spend with him until later in the summer.  Searched a bunch of places and chose this one so excited to go.  Service started very slow and inattentive but improved.  Food was \u201ceh\u201d. I purchased their high end cuts and wasn\u2019t blown away.  Wine by the glass was terrible.  $20 a glass for J Lohr Cab.  Terrible.  Charge me $20 for JUSTIN or something comparable.  Will not go back.  Just not worth it.  I spent $425 including 20% tip for 3 people and I have had much better for that cost."

Not one person tried to tell him he was being extremeley loud and rude. We were left for almost 15 minutes to not order when we sat down.  Not the level of service I would expect from a steakhouse.  If we are paying for it, you all should be able to deliver.  Not impressed at all.  Would never recommend."

Better yet, go to Japan. $1,300.00 for 3.5 people (3 adults and 1 toddler). The hostesses had attitude problems. I mean smile you're working in customer service for goodness sakes."

In addition, we ordered a variety of sides and starters.  The octopus salad and mashed potatoes was delicious, as was the cauliflower.  For dessert, we ordered the creme brulee trio and the sorbet.  The black sesame creme brulee stood out for all of us.  The restaurant surprised us with a chocolate cake surprise for the birthday girl.  The wait staff was attentive, friendly and helpful."

You see this in hotels, but not usually in high end restaurants.   I was also surprised to see the bartender being responsible for serving food in the lounge which left the bar unattended for some time early on a Monday night.  As for the food, the mac and cheese looked very basic, but the Ribeye steak was huge and flavorful."

The lobster bisque was delicious but it needed to be served much hotter, I had to eat it faster than I'd planned to avoid cold bisque.  I asked for bread with it but it was never brought to me which was upsetting because the tables are set with a bread plate and a butter knife.  What's the point if there is no bread??  Confusing.  The New York strip was very good as was my husband's prime rib.  The cauliflower and mushroom sides were fine, nothing spectacular.  We enjoyed our meal but not for the $222 we paid for it.  We didn't even have wine."

This was one of four or five reds served by the glass...like running out of prime rib how do you not have bottles of your glass pours at the ready?

We had the truffle fries, lobster tempura, wagyu sliders, steak tartare, New York steak and the fillet.. the only decent food was the fries and NY steak. Tartare was tasteless, lobster tempura was very soggy, sliders were average, fillet mignone super tender but the glaze was terrible. So many fine dinning options in SF to return here.  Our server was nice."

The food didn't wow me, especially with the prime rib that we asked for medium rare and got medium.  Our drinks came out seemly slow considering there did not appear to be any patrons in the bar area; bartenders appeared to be standing around chatting with each other.  Our server was very good and attentive to us.  Overall, the rating will be much lower than what I had given the restaurant on previous visits.  Still a good restaurant for eating steak; though I may suggest saving the prime rib for a steak house that specializes in prime rib."

All in all.....a so so experience that I won\u2019t be returning to.   Also, as a side note, the most expensive red wine by the glass was from one of the worst wineries in Healdsburg.   At $22.00 per glass, they should be ashamed of themselves.   Instead, we ordered a half bottle of the Rafanalli.  They should be bringing in perhaps Seghasio zin for that money.   I live in Healdsburg and no restaurant in Healdsburg would serve the choices they offer by the glass."

They sat us at a 2-seat table where the sides come up, but only opened 1 side stating the couldn\u2019t open the other because of another table nearby. They also said they couldn\u2019t seat us at any of the other open tables because they have people coming. I guess our reservations meant nothing.Thankfully the table next to us was kind and didn\u2019t mind the other side being open. The oysters were good, nothing special. I had the ribeye and the girls had the t-bone. We\u2019ve had our share of steaks before and found 5a5 to have really fatty steaks, not marble fat, but chunks of fat that we would have to cut off.  The sides were okay and we didn\u2019t try dessert. Overall, not impressed nor would I take my husband here. Waiter was nice but the overall experience and food were lacking."

The downside and the reason I won\u2019t go back are 2 things.First everything was way overpriced.  Wine list too expensive, dinners too expensive, sides and starters too expensive.  Fortunately for me it was a business meal,  but even though my company paid, it was out of line.Second reason was that the waiter was condescending.  He gave me the impression that he thought I was cheap for only ordering the $90 bottle of wine, not the $250 bottle he recommended.   He also padded the bill by suggesting way too much food for the 4 of us to eat.  At steak places like this sides are shareable,  but he wanted us to order 4 for the table.  We did order 3 sides and ate less than 1/3 of each.  There are much better restaurants in SF."

Filet Mignon was super tender.The bussers skill was amazing I wish I could bus that well he cleared the whole table and wiped it in one go.

We dined in prime rib (cooked to perfection), mashed potatoes, cauliflower and mushrooms- all were a culinary delight.  Our waiter was extremely knowledgeable about the wine list and suggested the Pinot Noir which complimented the meal.   The birthday dessert was small bites was sufficient to whet our senses."

            "Review": "If you like steak, this is NOT the restaurant to visit!  2 friends and I visited on Saturday night, and we were excited to try 5A5 given the reviews.  Clearly, the owners have several family members reviewing this place, because no independent reviewer would give this a passing grade.  The meal started with slow service and a 30 minute wait for our reservation.  But, that was forgivable as the bar has a nice atmosphere.  Once we were seated, we started with the Shisito peppers (actually very good, highlight of the meal), and Wagyu sliders.  The sliders were a foreshadowing of what was to come...the meal slid downhill from there!  Despite being ordered medium rare, they were served almost raw.   Nothing \"special\" about these, and tasted like any slider you would get off the \"passed trays\" at any mid-level wedding.  They make a big deal out of their Wagyu here, and we all expected something more. Salads were next, the baked salad with an egg.  This dish was ok.  Then the trouble really began.  The 3 of us ordered the $80 Ribeye.  I only mention the price because there is an expectation of a good piece of meat.  Again, not only were all 3 of our dishes WAY undercooked, the meat was tough, filled with gristle, and we were forced to send all of them back.  It was inedible.  Honestly, we spent the night listing places we had better steak at, and it didn't take Morton's or Joe's to beat it.  We're talking Applebee's, Chili's and business class on United were better.  The sides we ordered, the spinach, mushrooms, and cauliflower were serviceable, but again, nothing special. The manager Matthew was the one bright spot.  He apologized profusely, and did what he could to salvage the experience.  But, after being there for hours, we weren't about to wait for another hour for a new steak.  He didn't seem at all surprised by how poor the food was.  I'm guessing his main job is apologizing to customers for the food.  We left still a bit hungry, and definitely disappointed."

The wagyu beef was truly an item not to miss if your wallet (corporate or personal) can stand the assault!!!!  Our waiter, Chris, had worked there five years was very good and it was enjoyable interacting with him during our meal. The appetizers we ate, recommended by Chris, were very good (lobster tempura and the shishito peppers). Our t- bone steaks were very good and  cooked as requested."

We did not get the complimentary sparkling wines as it was advertised on Open Table at the time of making the reservation. I was not going to ask for freebies but if you do advertise it the hostess or the server should be aware of any specials offered. The people seated around us did get it, so it might have been an oversight. I don\u2019t personally think oversights are acceptable at a restaurant of this caliber, so no 5 stars because of it. I would come again."

Since it left a lot to be desired for the price, we felt it was an overpriced dinner and most likely will not go back.  I had the lobster bisque, but it was not a great flavor and since the lobster meat was added to it in the center (it was nice presentation) it didn't seem to go well with the bisque for some reason or do anything for the flavor.  My wife had the grilled romaine salad and we agreed it was interesting, and maybe the best of what was ordered -- which shouldn't be the case at a restaurant showcasing steak.  My filet was cooked perfectly and was very tender; however, the demi glace and green garlic flavors conflicted and didn't make the overall taste something I would recommend to anyone or order again. She ordered the t-bone because the ingredients peaked her interest, but it was a very strong flavor warranting a few bites only.  The truffle mac & cheese was ok, but not anything great or special."

My wife broke down each persons bill and what each owed as she has done for our family for the past 28 years. They have a app now so it's much easier to take a picture of bill and separate it. She puts amount on paper and the amount to be charged .to each card He charged the different amounts but I have never heard of this before.  The person who delivered the bill to the table , sat the bill on table no communication no eye contact and left not sure what that was about. This was not the waiter or our server he was great. Overall good food great service but these other two incidents threw me for a  loop."

So glad we did! First of all, the hostess was very sweet and professional. We arrived 30 minutes early and she told us she would have a table for us soon and we could go to the bar/lounge while we wait. The bartender, Michael, was outstanding. By far, the best service we've ever received. He was very knowledgeable and friendly. The restaurant was very clean and had a nice intimate setting. Perfect for date night! We started off with the tempura lobster and the shishito peppers.  I ordered the filet mignon and my boyfriend ordered the tbone. Both were cooked to perfection and seasoned well.  By far the best restaurant we visited in SF and one of the best I have ever dined at. Job well done. Highly recommend."

We enjoyed Prime Ribs, truffle fries and asparagus, and cauliflower .. all was served hot and super tasty! Will definitely go back again !"

Price/value: people often think of price and value as the same thing... They are  not! Is it expensive to dine here? Yes, if you choose the certified Japanese Wagyu steaks. Value - you may only find a handful of restaurants in the US that actually serves REAL Wagyu steak. So for what you get, the value is amazing! I would highly recommend this steakhouse! Thanks for the incredible dining experience"

When she arrived, I was told that they canceled my reservations because I didn't check in.   Which I clearly did.  Was then told it would be about 5 minutes.  30 minutes later after going to the hostess twice, we finally got a table.  After 10 minutes wait they decided menus might be a help.The waiter then proceeded to splash my date drink all over her.  Luckily it only hit her face, into the eye and down the arm.  Upon her cleaning up some, we decided to leave.   Not wanting to make a bigger display, we just asked for the bill for the drinks and proceeded to leave.  At this time the manager decided to try to make it up.  He tried so hard that he followed us next door to Kokkari.I will never step into this place again, but highly recommend Kokkari next door.  It was amazing service, and they went out their way to make night great for us anyway.   We go out at least one night a week.  This week it is The Boulevard and next to La Mars.  This is the first time I ever felt the need to write a review.   DO NOT GO TO  5A5 Steak Lounge.PS:  the system made me put something in for value and quality of food.  I must be honest, we never tried the food.  So the values are just place setters"

So I sent them back and said I am okay with medium well but to me medium well is not bleeding on your plate.  When they came back they were still too pink inside for me.  I nibbled around the edges that were done enough for me.  Someone else ordered the Mary Free Range Chicken and it was pink inside too.  I guess we are just used to food cooked until it is done.   This did affect my ratings but it is probably more me than the restaurant.  It is just hard to know what medium well is in restaurants as they did not give me any range.  If the waiter had said medium well is going to be bleeding then I would have said well done.  And I did not think to ask."

I don't ever write reviews either.They did not have 7 different things we ordered off the menu. 4 different wines (a Merlot, the Rose and two others), Bombay Sapphire gin and two other things.We asked for tap water and got bottled water which I reiterated we didn't want but, they still charged us for. Our appetizer's were comped but, it was still a $250 meal for 3 people who weren't just expensing a business meal. Although that's how it felt we were being treated.'These people have money to spend, let's upsell them on the meat, the wine, (even) the water'It was laughable. We went to Kokarri and drank wine there afterward, they actually had what we wanted and atmosphere there is top notch by comparison."

Everyone in our party ordered a cold sushi spoon appetizer. The hamachi-uni spoon was excellent.For my meal, I got the wagyu beef sliders (2 per order) and the truffle mac and cheese.  The truffle flavor was very prominent, I enjoyed both of my orders!My date ordered the mushroom side prime rib with foie gras served on top for an additional cost. This add-on was not advertised on the menu, but he saw it in an online review. He thought the steak was cooked perfectly and very tender, and I agree. Our friends got another steak and the maple bacon mashed potato and prosciutto asparagus.  Everything was amazing!My cocktail was pretty good. Everyone else in our party tried scotch. Our friends got the 3-scotch tasting, and enjoyed that.The only negatives are the noise level (hard to hear conversation across the booth) and the booth style seating where we sat was significantly lower than the table, so it was a bit awkward to be cutting steak at that angle."

You don't think fake truffles are a little overpowering for kobe beef? I also think it is funny when they offer prime rib and are sold out 30 minutes after opening in a room that is barely 25% full. But my main concern is that we asked for medium rare and were served a steak that was blue in the middle. The tables on either side of us had similar issues (for example woman asked for medium and was served rare). The only crucial  thing a steakhouse has to do is cook a steak to specifications. Massive fail for $170."

I expected better ambiance and food quality for the price.I was told to try Epic in SF and now I wish we would have. We were also disappointed there was no valet.

This time three of us had the prime rib.  Each  was ordered medium rare but came out rare.  This would have been tolerable had it not been so tough.  Admittedly, we did not shell out for their 200$ wagyu beef but at a steak restaurant one would expect that even the standard \"domestic\" cuts should be decent.  This turned out to be a D+.  Could not have measured up to a usda choice roast I could have purchased at the local supermarket.  Will not be returning.  Waiter was friendly and accommodating."

Our server was not very kind in explaining this. He was even rude at times. I explained to him that I had a bad shellfish allergy and he kept questioning me, saying things like, \"well how allergic are you anyway?\". I also had a bug in my wine and my friend had one crawling on his wine glass. We still tipped very well but this was NOT the service I would expect for a $511 meal. Overall delicious meal though. I think it was just a server issue."

The server  brought our steaks and cream of spinach (which was Delish) but the gnocchi was either forgotten by the waiter or the Chef; either way, the server advised that the gnocchi would take a long time to prepare so I elected the Mac and cheese by default...........and with disappointment."

Our server was very pompous about the quality of food but unfortunately the chef did not deliver.  This restaurant certainly does not deserve to be mentioned in the same discussion with other top quality steak houses."

The d\u00e9cor was beautiful and loved the way the tables were placed in a circle.  First, the service is outstanding.  The food was delicious and the presentation was beautiful.  For those of us who are more adventuresome we had the Wagu beef tartar and lobster along with many other plates and the person who was just a steak eater had a perfectly cooked filet.  I must say I'm not a desert person but we ordered two for the table were not only delicious but the presentation was out of this world.  It was the perfect evening."

The one complaint I have is that almost all the sides (including the vegetable options!) come with some sort of pork in them.  I made a comment about this to our server, but I'm not sure if the feedback got to the chef or not.  But seriously, why do creamed spinach, asparagus, mashed potatoes and cauliflower ALL come with meat in them??  I understand it's a steak house, and I'm not opposed to meat - I like it a lot!  But having pork in almost every side dish you offer is insensitive to people who don't eat pork.  Let's keep the veggie options (at least SOME of them) free of meat!"

I booked a reservation wayyyy in advance and the table we were given was next to a pole and not desirable for an advance booking. Last minute reservation or walk-in sure, the table would be fine for that.  My bread plate and the table were dirty, they ran out of spoons, so they never gave us any. So we couldn't eat part of our meal. Good thing I didn't get the soup. They ignored us because we were placed at a bad table. When they took our plates to box the food, they placed dirty dishes directly on my food!!! Carry what you can and come back, don't put dirty dishes on my food. Overall very disappointing. Food amazing, I doubt I would go back."

My girlfriend and I chose a t-bone and a ribeye along with the mushroom side. Both those steaks were average middle of the road in terms of texture and flavor, and came heavily coated in their respective sauces (I knew this going in). I'm from New York, and this is the context I'm using for this review - I eat steak on the regular and unfortunately I wouldn't return for either of the two steaks listed above. The restaurant staff was incredibly friendly and exceptional in their quality of service. I will return to try the Waygu."

Fish is frozen in the middle area so as my friend's fish too so we sent it back and got a so called cooked fish now but other than that nothing special so bland dessert not very good. I am sorry but I am just being honest there is no love in that cooking and we paid $600 for nothing. Just love the job if you are asking for $150 ++ a person then make the most outstanding of it. New Year's is once in a year only so better cook with passion. That's all"

For being a self claimed high standard steakhouse we had good expectations going in but our steaks were tasteless and overcooked.  Probably the worst steak we've ever had! The beets in the beet salad were overly salted and tasted like they had been soaked in a brine too long.  We overheard a person at a table next to us complaining about the same thing.  She sent hers back while we only ate a small portion of ours.  There was no question that like we overpaid for a poor quality meal and we were extremely dissatisfied.  We were tempted to dispute the charges but we let it go. The wait staff was good enough and we tipped very generously despite the bad experience.  We were a party of two and spent $500 for a terrible meal!  Money down the drain!!  We will never go back!"

The Oaxacan Cocktail is the best on the menu. Would have drank those the entire night but wanted to try every drink on the menu.Our soups were the first to arrive, Lobster Corn Soup and Zoup du Jour (Saffron Mussel Soup). They were both very tasty, the first had a strong curry base while the second tasted more creamy, buttery. Next came the shishito peppers. By far the best variation I've ever had. Peppers were not to spicy and had a sweet reduction on top of the Truffle shavings. This was a must have for sure.Our steaks finally came, the T-Bone with egg. The best steak paired with their special sauce I've ever had. Definitely next time, I'd love to try their wagyu steak. Unfortunately, the service was a bit weird. Our empty waters sat there for half an hour before being filled. Our final order of cocktails came out way late too. It seems that once they give the final dish, they stop coming to check."

Apparently you need to be there in the first 30 minutes of opening to consume the prime rib (per our waiter). We left. And we went to the kitschy but reliably good House of Prime Rib for prime rib (which was worth the 2 hour wait - which tells you how unimpressed we were with every aspect of 5A5)."

The ambiance was just so right and the waiters not waiter really took care of us by bringing complimentary food. Although it is a bit pricey it was still worth it and the steak was amazing! Overall I give it a 4.8 out of 5 it was a really good experience for my girlfriend and I who left satisfied and full"

I had the prime rib and my boyfriend got the bone in ribeye and they were both cooked perfect and tasted great! The prices were as expected. Would definitely go back !"

Trendy crowd, odd 90's retro decor, with loud blaring  disco music. Don't think we will be back since it's obvious the crowd they are marketing to (dare I say the crowd that has more money than sense) ,  doesn't really care about the food or the dining. As mentioned in previous reviews, this place is about up selling, starting with the presentation of hunks of-- dried out looking-- meat. You'll see the prices on the menu when you look for them; I wasn't shocked because I know what Japanese Wagyu retails for. None of the entrees seem to be served with accompaniments so if you are hungry (which is why we went!) expect to order many add ons. Why are there no steakhouses that serve plain baked potatoes (a big profit maker!) ?  Why do we need 10 ingredients in every side dish or salad?  So they can charge $12+ for a plate. Food here is WAY too overworked and busy.  Waiter seemed insulted that we only wanted wine by the glass; very limited selection.  The whole evening was just too weird."

My husband and I tried the filet mignon Wagyu style and it slices like butter.  For the appetizer try the Octopus,  it melts in your mouth.  So yummy.  Our dinner choices were prime rib and filet mignon regular style with mashed potatoes and creamed spinach sides and those choices were amazing too.  Service was awesome.  You never had an empty water glass."

            "Review": "We were going to see a play at the Eureka Theatre across the street. We checked out the local restaurants before deciding on 5A5 Steak Lounge.  The valet server who took our car was great, he told us to pick up the car after the play. The Mixologist at the bar concocted a Tanquray Martini, she sprinkled the class with vermouth before pouring in the gin and added a orange spray. Delicious! The waiters are numerous and were top notch and fun, especially, Ali. The menu  gave us many delicious choices.  We started with an amuse bouche, wonderful, enjoyed the best hamburgers, truffle fries and mac and cheese.  Dessert was three small scoops of ice cream which tasted like they were made by the pastry chef.We will come back to 5A5 Steak Lounge soon."

            "Review": "The food was fine, but wouldn't pay that much to go there again--many other steak houses in the city with better food, especially for the price. Certainly many places that are that expensive with MUCH better ambiance. Food aside, I *really* didn't like the ambiance of the place, the lighting was super bright, it was very loud, and gave the impression of sitting in some sort of modern but cheap cafeteria where you're basically shouting to hear the person sitting across the table from you. The bathrooms are gross, all one bathroom for men and women with a trough sink ... no thank you. The booths feel really close to each other which is exacerbated by the way that they are arranged where it feels like the people next to you are filling the empty spaces at your table bc they are arranged kitty-corner. Also, the valet left the lights on in my car and when we came out the car was dead and the valet offered no assistance and we found jumper cables and got the car started by ourselves. Try House of Prime Rib, Alexander's, Ruths Chris, Espetus, etc etc. before this place."

This place looked like it was going to be a great place, but I was mistaken.  The noise was almost unbearable as well.  Now, realize that I dine out at least twice a week and always search for amazing restaurants, but, I'm sorry to say, I won't be going back here.  The pentacle reviews were overstated.  Oh, as a side not I also worked in the restaurant biz for 15 years.  I'm not a rookie.  I'm sorry to be leaving this review."

It was acknowledged by the staff as they came by multiple times to apologize.  But what got really frustrating is they apologized a final time and asked if we wanted something else to eat while we waited.  He offered a few different appetizer options and we selected one.  That appetizer then appeared on the check as they charge me for it!The second big problem is they asked if we ever ate there before.  We both said \"no.\"  He then proceeded to show us their lineup of steaks and asked if we ever heard of that kind of steak.  We both said \"no.\"  My business guest chose one and the waiter simply took the order.  He never found it necessary to let us know the steak was 256 dollars!  That seems like an obvious curtesy given we've never been there before, never heard of that steak, and the prices aren't listed online.  Very very money grubbing place."

The imaginative sides more than complemented the delicious steaks. Everything was a treat down to the desserts and the Japanese whiskey flights. I highly recommend that Mac and cheese, the creamed spinach, saut\u00e9ed mushrooms, and bacon topped mashed potatoes. I assure you, the flavors will light up your palet."

The one that was supposed to be cooked well-done was cooked medium at the most and all three of the filets were served lukewarm (at best).  As I mentioned, we should have called our server over and asked her to take them back and warm them up but our server never checked on us.  We were not alcohol drinkers and I cannot help but think our lack of ordering alcohol may have contributed to the inattentiveness of our server.  If we ever went again I would order two orders of Lobster Tempura and I would make them my entree.  I would go back just to have that again!  As far as steaks go, we would go to a different San Francisco restaurant.We did love the ambiance of the restaurant and everyone was extremely nice and welcoming."

One, made a reservation and showed up little early and waited patiently in lounge area. Was told that they would call us up when table was ready, our time comes up but they forget about us and help others to their tables before us even though they came later. Two, host sat us in right next to a big group even though there were open tables away from the big crowd. Three, server was attentive initially but after bringing the food out we did not get checked for drink refill or any follow up. Also took 10-15 mins to get our bill after we had asked for the bill."

They have a nice assortment of Japanese Whiskeys (tasted ok) but also had a nice selection of scotches too (I stuck with my Macallan). She had a T-Bone, I had their Wagyu Filet. My thinking: you go to a burger spot for their burgers, not something else on the menu.Wagyu Filet was definitely an experience you will need to experience. It is on the pricier side (around 140ish for 4 oz) but I feel that its worth it. You can taste the laziness of spoiled life of the meat with every bite.WILL DEFINITELY COME AGAIN FOR WAGYU!"

This time, we felt we ate at Outback. (I haven't been to an Outback since college. Outback possibly serves better steaks.) The hamachi shots, the salads, the entrees taste cheaply made with inferior ingredients.The heirloom burrata salad had very little burrata. It's just a pile of tomatoes without any flavor.no efforts were put into this dish. The free bites were overly seasoned, so sweet and overpowering. It was gross.The lobster tempura  was the only acceptable dish.The New York steak looked so sad. It looked like the meat had sat in the kitchen for a week. It tastes chewy.  We couldn't finish it.The sweet potato gnocchi was very salty and heavy. It's not SF cooking. It's more of \"fancy\" Midwest cooking.  This was a very disappointing experience.  We rarely visit the same restaurant more than once a year because there are so many cool new ones to try.  This return trip was horrifying. Now we can permanently cross 5A5 off our visiting list."

The bone in ribeye was just OK, the mushroom side dish and creamed spinach were very good.  There was an extremely long delay between the appetizer and main course.  Then our waiter completely disappeared and we sat with empty plates in front of us for far too long once our main dishes were done.  We had to chase him down for the bill.  The decor is very dated and the bathroom stinks - literally.  They smelled and were dirty.  I booked this for a business dinner and I left embarrassed that I had recommended it.  Don't make the same mistake."

I had the skirt steak which they had pieces of ginger which did nothing to help with the steak and it actually took away from the flavor. We also had he rib eye which was better but over all I expected more and it seem to be just okay but nothing to write home about. It was still an okay night but it was nothing special. They still have a good steak and good service, but nothing to brag about especially considering the price you pay, which is not cheap."

Summer crowd of tourists more interested in their cell phones than their company and the food. Some furniture in disrepair; booth sofa torn, so we asked for another table. Service friendly enough, however amateurish, unexoected for a high end restaurant.  Wine should be offeret and served with the meal, not into the meal."

I was very excited about this place, I had chosen it over many others to celebrate my boyfriends 30th birthday and on top of that the itinerary I had created was a surprise. We arrived early and were seated in a less than desirable area of the restaurant. My boyfriend mentioned to the hostess that we would prefer to sit in a more central location to be able to enjoy the full ambiance of the restaurant (after all it was his 30th birthday and it should be a unique and special experience). This was the first fault of many that we endured while trying to dine here.. Which is very disappointing since I booked through open table and I usually have a great experience when I do at other restaurants. Then we ordered our drinks which came after waiting a short while. For appetizers we ordered the kale salad and the truffle fries, for main entrees we ordered the salmon and Wagyu ribeye plus a side of asparagus. This is where things went awry, we waited and waited and waited... Nothing... People around us got their food and we only had bread.. Finally we spoke to the manager who offered to comp our drinks but we declined, I wasn't going to wait any longer and pay that type of bill for such a terrible experience. I would not recommend this place to anyone, not even people I dislike.. I feel that this may have been a fluke but is it really worth risking your special event and feeling the way I felt when I left? I highly doubt it.. Just a warning."

But last Saturday evening they allowed a Birthday party with 5+ children in a private room that was just getting started around 6pm.   The noise and the children walking around is not something you want or  expect when you having a $300 dinner.  The manager finally closed the door after an hour but the evening had been dampened by then.  Plus, the table next to us not at all dressed appropriately and was watching the Warriors game with sound.  I am not sure restaurants understand that when they enable and tolerate very rude people it ruins the experience for many."

This includes their excellent choices in A5 Wagyu cuts.  They add different sauces to their steaks rather than let the meat stand alone.  That is fine for me but may not be if folks like their steak bare or with the sauces on the side.  It was different for me.  The sides were very good.  There were very unique pinafores.  We had their mushrooms which was good as well as their mashed potatoes.   Dessert was great.  Quality is what you would expect from a higher end restaurant like this.  Why I felt I had to write a review, was because of the service.  I felt we were not treated right by our server.  It was not busy the night we went.  Our server took our order and repeated it three times to us.  Also wrote it down.  I thought that was cool. But then one of our main dishes was missing.  And our server was no where to be found.  I had to track down our server to ask about our missing dish after all of our other dishes were brought out.  When the server finally came to check on us and we informed him of the missing dish, he blamed the mistake on us.  This was after he repeated the order to us three times in the beginning.   That piece kind of ruined our experience.  If he just apologized and owned the mistake we would have been fine, but to blatantly just say it was our fault.  There were three of us there they heard him repeat the order three times and witnessed him write it down.  After that again we did not see our server for extended periods of time.   I had to get up and find our server for our bill.  That one piece did not sit well with us.  Not sure if we would go back especially with other great steak places like Alexander's and Bobo's."

Possibly due to it being a 32oz cut and almost 2\" thick but would rather have it cooked a bit more evenly and thorough for medium rare. Was medium on the outside and rare in the middle. Definitely needed more attention when cooking. Next time if we return will order medium but then it may be well done on the outside and medium rare in the middle. Iceberg salad was amazing as was the house cab (good pairing with the rib eye) and mashed potatoes. Unfortunately the asparagus side was overcooked and a bit droopy."

They were kind enough to accommodate us but table was directly under A/C vent & my wife was freezing whole meal despite asking several staff to turn it down. We switched sides, but she was still pretty uncomfortable.  We should have moved. Not the restaurant's fault obviously, but we were surrounded by tables with small children who were clearly over the steak lounge vibe, was a surprise on the so-so ambiance.We didn't opt not for the Wagyu beef but still paid hefty prices for a filet & bone-in rib-eye.  My wife orders her steak well-done (I know...) but usually isn't a prob but they brought out a charred piece of meat so dry & tasteless that we were shocked!  We hardly ever send food back, but this hockey puck went back.  They were quick to bring out a replacement, maybe too quick as 2nd steak was closer to medium than well, but by then she wasn't prepared to send another steak back again.  We had truffle mac & shrooms as sides. Mac was avg, shrooms were very good.  We didn't notice until half-way through our meal other tables were getting an amuse-bouche compliments of chef, but we never did. No biggie by itself, but just added to an overall slighted feel.Early I mentioned on the sly to waiter that it was her birthday & he let the staff know, but at the end of meal we were presented with dessert menus anyway & when we didn't order anything there, we were given check like it was time to go...no birthday desert. The bill was wrong (they charged us twice for the bad filet and the replacement both) so I had to send that back too. They clearly forgot the birthday desert (I get its complimentary so don't expect anything ), but by then I told them not to worry about it when waiter brought the corrected bill back and he seemed to take offense & brought it anyway. We left it untouched - bad B-day experience!"

IT WAS BETTER THAN THE HOUSE OF PRIME RIB ( IT WAS EXPENSIVE BUT WORTH IT). I HAD THE BONE-IN RIB-EYE.  AGAIN, COOKED PERFECT.  OUTSTANDING!!! I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND IF YOU CAN PAY $200 FOR AN OUTSTANDING MEAL. GREAT PLACE."

My husband's steak came smothered with a cup of sauce that was sickly sweet and incredibly salty at the same time, he spent ages scraping it off to attempt to eat some of it. Call me old-fashioned, but  steak sauce should come on the side, specially one so overpowering as this..."

If you're looking for authentic, melt in your mouth, marble, top quality A5 100% Japanese Miyazaki Wagyu beef, you have to give it try here. It was soo good! Buttery goodness! The Tajima F1 was really tasty too. You can tell the difference of course between the 100% Wagyu and the Tajima but I really enjoyed the cut and it was very flavorful and tasty with a good buttery-ness too. We also had the truffle fries which were one of the bests we've had also. It was an overall great experience at 5A5 and the food was superb. The server and waitstaff were great and attentive. Our server was very helpful as well. The palate cleanser sorbet and compliments of the chef tasting was very yummy too."

We really enjoyed lounging at the bar prior to being seated at our table for five. We were celebrating both a 68th birthday and 20th anniversary, and it was made very special by the staff by bringing out two complimentary desserts with the words Happy Birthday and Happy Anniversary written in chocolate syrup! Service was excellent: very attentive, without being overwhelming or intrusive. We tried two of the A5 Wagyu beef offerings, along with the dry aged bone-in T-bone, filet mignon, rib-eye, several sides, and appetizers. Dessert selection was minimal and more \"fancy\" than flavorful. The meats were tender and cooked to perfection. The flavor of each dish was unique and intense, but when you put everything  together in a meal, it almost overwhelmed your palate. The biggest downside was that everything was overly salted.We anticipated spending a lot of money, but thought $1,000 (including tip) was a bit high for a party of five. The atmosphere was amazing, and we had a fantastic evening; we may return again, but only for a special celebration."

We ordered our meals (an appetizer, 1 steak, 1 prime rib, two sides to share and a bottle of wine).  The appetizer arrived promptly and was good. More than 30 minutes later, our waiter returned to tell us they were out of prime rib. This was probably 45 minutes after we had ordered! He brought (rubbery and overcooked) lobster tail to tide us over. When our meat arrived, neither were medium rare as we ordered and both side dishes were wrong. The meat wasn't especially flavorful either. Our waiter tried his best, but multiple mistakes on a $400 dinner for two is unacceptable. I won't be going back nor do I recommend this place."

I think it's great when a restaurant makes a specific menu for a special day, it makes it easier to order and we know the food will come out great.  We brought our own wine and our server opened it easily for us.  The server really knew the menu and told us which dishes he preferred!  The food was great and we even got to sample a small peace of fois gras.  Overall, I was very happy with the dinner, I will come back for another date night!"

It's on the pricier side so we tried the next best thing: half Wagyu, half Holstein (Australian). Which was really good! We were told chef tends to cook on the rare side so I said medium well and it was prefect! My husband got the filet mignon- equally great. Service was attentive and we received a lovely amouse busche."

Came here for a birthday celebration and ordered truffle fries, a A5 and a 50/50 wagyu Holstein steaks. Truffle fries were just as addicting as they were years ago although the fries were more on the shorter end than last time, probably got the end of the batch. The steaks were perfectly cooked to the medium well I wanted. The restaurant was very understanding because it was Superbowl weekend and the festivities pushed back our original reservation time a whole 2 hours. They still were able to seat us despite the later hour and even prepared a beautiful birthday plate at the end of our meal for my guest's birthday. Will definitely come back again for another special occasion."

First of all, I must say the service was by far the best we've ever received at ANY restaurant. Everyone, especially our waitress, was so friendly. Our water was constantly being refilled, even when there was still 3/4 left. The presentation of the food is outstanding. Everything was beautiful. Prices were reasonable for the quality of the food too! Only complaints: I ordered the Filet, and the sauce on the filet was not really necessary. Although my steak was delicious, I think it would have been better without the sauce. The more simpler, the better when you are eating quality steak! We ordered the lobster for our appetizer and it was nothing special... However the bacon wrapped dates, cauliflower, spinach were great. They also gave us a yummy brownie that said \"congratulations\" on the plate. Overall, I would recommend 5A5. Excellent service and beautiful presentation of food, as well as good food."

The bone-in ribeye was very good, and I recommend it if you go. However, we also ordered a Tajima steak, which is 50/50 wagyu/holstein. It was good, but doused in sauce and totally not worth the price (the bone in ribeye was better). Also, the wagyu prices were way over the top, some 50% more than other restaurants I've been to (for example, high end steakhouses in Vegas... I'm not saying it's worth it at those restaurants, but I can't understanding why the prices are so much higher here). Fortunately we didn't order the overpriced wagyu.  Anyway, the food was okay, just not worth the money, and the restaurant has a kitchy feel to it; high end prices, but mid-tier ambience. Save your money."

            "Review": "This is a steak house I go to when I visit SF. Last couple times, I splurged on Wagyu beef, which was their specialty. They were sublime, but cost $250 - 500 a dish. So, that is for business dinners. This time I went with a friend and was embarrassed to order an extravagant main course. So, I tried their dry aged T Bone. The sauce and the soft poached egg on top were nice. The meat was ok. It was a solid steak, but not exceptional. My friend had the prime rib which he liked. We both loved lobster tempura appetizer. The wine list is stronger for CA and OR wine, which is fair since it is a west coast restaurant. The ambiance is lively, chic but not too loud.  The server this time was rude, but last few times the servers were nice. It was probably because we went there relatively late in the evening."

Then had the crab salad, and some bread with bacon baked into it.  The Waygu 4oz Rib eye was the star of the night, completely unbelievable taste!  The New York as my entree couldn't compare after eating the Waygu.  Recommend the mashed potatoes with bacon  cooked in maple syrup as a side.Next time I'm ordering this: Two cocktails, the crab salad, 8oz Waygu Rib eye, and the mash potatoes."

Crazily is was even better than the New York strip, which was well cooked but a bit tough. The filet looked fantastic on the tables next to us, but we didn't get the change to try it.Also, my goodness, the lobster bisque. Oh lordy, I need more of that in my life. It too was incredible. A must if it's available when you go.Additionally, the service all night was truly great. Friendly and attentive without being annoying in the slightest."

It may be better experience with a full menu.  Everyone in my group kept saying everything was \"okay\".  I will say after 4 days in San Francisco I did not eat anywhere where the food and service were solid \"A's\".  I've been to many big cities and eaten at many fine dining restaurants and I can't say I would automatically recommend it.  But, everyone there seemed nice including management.  Management did come by the table to check on us (which was nice) but we elected not to say anything with everything being okay. I don't usually complain unless things are terrible."

The Food - The food here is experimental, rich and truly an experience. This restaurant serves bacon bread as a complimentary starter - an indication that you are really in for fun dining experience. Start with the hamachi spoon appetizer. The flavor combination of uni, strawberries, pickled seaweed and ponzu sauce is really remarkable. For a main course, trying one of the cuts of meat that 5A5 is known for is a must. If you want to spend a bit more for true luxury, the wagyu beef selection is perfectly marbles for a mouthwatering meal. If you can get there early enough, try the prime rib. This sells out most nights, but is worth getting there a bit early. If you a good piece of meat, but don't want to break the bank or get there at 4:00p - the filet mignon is your dish.Ambiance - 5A5 has a great 1950's lounge vibe. Lots of round leather booths, dark lighting, and a bar that looks like it could be from a scene in Mad Men. Great place for drinks with friends or dinner.Service - Generally, the service here is really great. We went on a night where service we quite slow. From meal order to meal arrival, was probably about an hour or more. Granted, with good food comes good wait patience. While the food did take a bit of time to arrive, the staff frequently checked in on us and made sure that our drinks and bacon bread were filled.Overall, great steaks, and really unique food combinations. Definitely work trying."

Then made a New drink but brought the wrong one to the table. Also out of desert on the menu...When we complained...they seemed indifferent. Out was hard to get anyone's attention  and customer service seemed only genuine by our buser Jorge. He was attentive and smiling and in our opinion of the four of us felt he was much more deserving of serving the food than just water and clearing plates..He was great and helped to handle our other requests that no one else seemed to care about!!

Parking was easy and free on the street. It was Sat night at 6.Hostess was ok. She had to finish her conversation with her coworker before greeting us. She didn't offer to take our coats but saw her take others.Waiter was great. Although he didn't go in depth about the different meats as a friend of mine led me to expect, he was very friendly and attentive throughout the meal. He never rushed us and in fact encouraged us to stay for dessert.The steaks----absolutely great! My husband ordered Wagyu ribeye. It was expensive but really distinct and mouthwatering and I will be coming back for it. I had the filet mignon. It was tasty and perfectly cooked, but paled in comparison to Wagyu. We had a party of 6 and everyone enjoyed their meals. The dessert of creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e was awesome!Loved this restaurant and will be back!"

T bone steaks, macaroni & lobster, mushrooms and bacon mashed potatoes were as good as it gets. The restaurant has a sleek sophisticated look. Our primary server, Scott, was assisted by the type professional staff a steak house requires. Definitely worth a meal or two at this very nice restaurant!"

So we ordered an alternate, 3 sides, and two appetizers. 10 mins later we were told that steak was sold out too, so we again chose something else.  When the $60 steak arrived it was very undercooked, so we sent it back. Our ($40 worth of) sides sat on the table for 10 minutes. The steak came back cooked properly but the sides were completely cold. All the food was okay but the place didn't live up to the hype. Or server Scott was great, but otherwise it was a total waste of money."

The hostess took us to a quieter section of the restaurant which was not that much quieter. The server was nice, we placed our order and probably because it was a Sunday night, almost every side dish we ordered was not available. They were probably waiting for the Sysco truck to arrive on Monday with supplies. Anyway the steaks arrived and they were not practically special or all that tasty. It was just mediocre. Needless to say I will stick with the Morton Steakhouse when in SF or better yet, stick with the Outback."

I had the Dry Aged Bone-in NY 22oz, medium rare, and it was absolutely delicious. I cut the sous vide egg on top and the wondrous yolk popped out. Then, I mixed it with the bacon jam on the bottom, as the waiter recommended and the combination was mind blowing. The bacon jam was not over powering and the egg really was \"perfect.\" My steak was perfectly cooked, tender, and juicy. I did not leave a single piece of it on my plate. All that was left was the bone. I would highly recommend this place if you are looking for a steak that is complex, but that's not to say you shouldn't try anything else on the menu!"

Making a reservation through OpenTable was really easy and the host even made sure to get the name of the birthday celebrant for the complimentary dessert at the end of the night (very nice touch!) The ambiance was classy and quiet enough for a romantic dinner.The Food:After looking at the menu (and drooling), we decided we wanted to try a lot of the items so we ended up sharing all of our plates and it was just the right amount of full.We had the soup of the day poblano soup, truffle mac & cheese, shrooms, bone-in rib eye, and a complimentary birthday chocolate cake dessert.To start, the sourdough and bacon bread was really delicious and I liked eating it with our appetizer soup.We had the soup of the day, poblano pepper soup which I  had not previously had before. It had a really nice and rich flavor! The peppercorn bone-in rib eye was the star of the show and was a lot of meat even when sharing. We got it medium rare and it came out perfect. I have only been to a few steakhouses before but this is definitely the best that I've had so far. The garlic mushrooms and mac & cheese were a good compliment to our steak with just the right amount of flavor.The Service:Service here was phenomenal! We were instantly greeted, seated on time, and our waiter walked us through the menu and gave suggestions which I really appreciated. He also checked on us regularly throughout the night which was really great!Food came out on time and palette cleansers in between dishes were interesting and delicious as well.I definitely want to come back and try the Wagyu experience...ONE DAY! $$$$"

The place is amazing, with impeccable lighting. What s classy joint! We were the first ones in for a 5:30pm reservation, besides a large party that had congregated at the bar, waiting for their table as well. The wait was like 5 minutes, if that. Very prompt! As we had gotten there early. I cannot begin to describe how awesome this experience was. So I will just get into it. The explanation of the menu was very thorough and very warm. Our waiter was awesome! The service we received was top notch. Including the guys bussing the table. We had a great view of the kitchen and it looked so calm in there. It was very reassuring! We ordered oysters, prime rib, boneless rib eye, beet salad with whipped goat cheese, truffle mac and cheese w/ lobster and creamy spinach. Everything was delightful. The oysters were the starter and it was a plethora of flavors in our mouths. They had a chili sauce on there with caviar. It was the first time I tried caviar and I was impressed. The whipped goat cheese on the beet salad was exquisite, as well as the reductions. The meat was beyond perfection. I like my meat rare and that's what I got. My boyfriend Mike felt like his medium rare was borderline medium. But the greatest medium ever. And that's what he actually wanted. He wants medium rare a bit more towards medium. The mac and cheese had chunks of lobster and may be the best thing I've ever tasted in my life. And the creamy spinach was surprising, with the crispies in it. It was a delicious contrast with the cream. A nice touch was the little extras that got sent out, compliments of the chef. There was a gnocchi with creamy truffle sauce. And warm sourdough bread, soft inside and crusty on the outside. And bacon bread as well. He sent out a palette cleanser before our main courses. We were taken care of! They even took my cost and remembered it!"

The sides were great, lobster mac, creamed spinach, all good.  And excellent presentation for all dishes throughout.  But the service was poor from start to finish, from arrival and having to wait at the entrance for no apparent reason, to an over-busy server, wine arriving too late for the course it accompanied, water glasses never re-filled (the bottle of sparkling water was put in an ice bucket across the room, we had to go and get it ourselves on many occasions), had to wait for service on several occasions. Embarrassing when you're on business. The ambience was very three star, not unpleasant but nothing of note. We had better food, service and ambience at Harris's and Ozumo on the two previous nights."

Appetizers and sides were good but our waiter talked us out of the filet mignon and into the bone-in NY strip. It was inedible for most of it and you couldn't even fully chew the meat. You had to chew it until a point and spit it out. Completely unacceptable for a place this upscale. We were disappointed to say the least."

No snobbery whatsoever: great food, terrific drinks, and a low-key lounge atmosphere made it the perfect place to have a celebratory meal. Will definitely be back for my 31st. Who am I kidding? I'll be back next month!"

Once again a couple decided to bring three young children to a fine dining experience. Why, why, why. The man at that the table was wearing jeans and a t-shirt which in my world is already disrespectful, but allowing one child to have loud crying outburst while another child climbs on the backs of the booth disrupting the group behind them is just unacceptable. If your children cannot behave like young adults in an adult setting please don't take them out to restaurants where they don't belong."

The bone in rib eye was excellent but the prime rib was sub par- both presentation and taste was not great.Service was slooooow. We received the main courses over 30 minutes after finishing our appetizers. Waiter was not attentive, and the succession of the meal was not smooth.Paying these type of prices, I would expect a seamless experience and this was just not the case. Appetizers were not great and service was even worst. I will not return here based on my experience."

The servers explain your food when presented. The restaurant is very pretty and loungey. They have some really expensive meat. The thing I liked best is when they called to confirm my reservation and they made it a point to ask if I was celebrating any sort of occasion or the like... I said as a matter of fact it's my fiance's birthday. So they made a special note of it and at the end of our meal, they had the cutest little dessert on a square plate that read 'Happy Birthday, Ivan in chocolate.' It was very sweet of them. =) This review was a 3 for the food which was good but not amazing...the service gets 6 stars imo."

Don't get me wrong - the steak was delicious! But the serving size was over the top!!My companion and I also order Brussels sprouts and creamed spinach to accompany our steaks. Brussels sprouts were far underdone and the spinach far too salty.Lastly, our server seemed extremely bored, and not in the mood to work. In my extensive experience of dining in fine SF restaurants, one can often rely on a bright personality from the serving staff to enhance the dining experience. NOT HERE. Our server offered the most brief and colorless answers to our queries about food and wine choices. And it wasn't because he was too busy.My advice: SF has much better dining experiences to offer. Take a pass on this place!"

Got a wonderful description and viewing of the waygo cuts that were offered.  I never knew a cow got daily massages to improve the marbling of the meat.  This persuaded us to try that waygo tartar appetizer which was wonderful.  I also got the beet salad which was visually stunning, well prepared and very delicious.The main course was american filet mignon with brussel sprouts as the side.  The meat was cooked perfectly and seasoned just right.  My only gripe was that I wanted a little more of the sauce but I can understand how the chef wanted the meat to be the star of the dish.  The brussel sprouts were done well and had a great flavor that wasn't too salty.Overall a great experience and a wonderful restaurant.  Will be back again for dinner with friends and maybe even a special occasion."

Handsome space and pleasant ambiance and low noise level.  We were seated in Siberia, although the restaurant was not full.  Were we placed there because we came from open table?  Otherwise the greeting was fine.  Service was pretty good (Siberia was a little off the beaten track for servitors)Tom Reynolds"

When there is an event/group in the bar area, the sound carries, likely because of the round structure of the restaurant.

They checked his coat at no cost, called us a cab when we were done and when I did not like my salad they took it back with no problems. The modern feel of the place was nice and the food was very good. My problem was I dressed up nice for a upscale steak house only to have people in there with pants sagging and boxers showing while wearing a hat, and another person in a basketball jersey. It really took away from the overall upscale feeling. But they did go out of their way to give us a special dessert with happy anniversary written on it."

My friend got there early and had a drink at the bar where he said the service was good and the drink even better.  We were seated after being asked which of a few choices we preferred and had a tour of the menu by an informed, passionate, professional server.  We each ordered an appetizer, salad, and entr\u00e9e.  Everything was served beautifully, promptly, and at the proper temperature.  The staff was attentive and engaged and our needs were important to them.  The only down side was that one of the side dishes was not great but, it was not so poorly executed that we returned it. Overall it was very nice.  I plan on returning and recommending A5A to friends."

The brussel sprouts had too much balsamic vinegarette so we expressed our dislike and they took it off which we're glad they did. We would go back and try other items."

The entire meal was exceptional, and worth every penny!!  The icing of the meal was the desert.  We had the Banana Dolce, and I have to say that the Chef truly outdid himself with this desert!!

The foie gras and the wonton pineapple appetizer was good after the wonton was sent back from being burned. The A5 Wagyu was great quality. However the rib cap I got was slightly on the saltier side. Maybe instead of butter topping they can add foie gras as a side option. The A5 prime rib was delicious. The macaroni with lobster side dish had to be sent back more than once. The first time it came back cold. The second time it was watery. We instructed a worker that we didn't want it anymore because we were done with our entree. The made another macaroni side dish that we honestly didn't want. Our server Jake was very hospitable and tried to make us as comfortable as possible. I will come back because the quality of steak is hard to get anywhere else in the bay area."

I've loved 5A5 since they opened and one of the reasons is that I always feel comfortable there, welcomed there and I actually experience the old ethnic diversity that SF used to be known and appreciated for. Again I say, the food and beverage menus are amazing- 1st rate everything from the welcomes to goodbyes. But there's so much more @ 5A5 - SF has become so homogenous as the new industries coming in to town make this City cookie cutter bland. I walk in to 5A5 to experience ambience that I cannot get in other restaurants- I get the San Francisco I grew up in, when everyone didn't look just alike. I don't know what you're doing 5A5, but keep doing it. I recommend you to all of my friends and family and they enjoy dining @ 5A5 too."

My only concern this visit was the amount of bacon in every side dish offered.  The mash potatoes, the brussell sprouts, and the spinach.  All I tasted was bacon with essences of the other veggies.  It was a little disappointing.  It dominated the flavor in my mouth. I could barely taste my steak.  The bread even had bacon in it.  And believe me, I love bacon but in moderation.  The experience reminded me of a heavy garlic Italian restaurant.  I don't recall so much bacon in everything the first time I ate at 5A5.I hope they will be revising their side dishes to have less bacon moving forward.  BTW - I asked to have the bacon pieces removed from the mash potatoes and the flavor was still in the potatoes.  Wishing for less bacon...."

My father and I got there about 30 minutes early we sat at the bar area enjoyed a couple of cocktails and just about lost track of time, the host kindly walked up told us we will hold your table until you're ready to eat we did not want to interrupt, we don't see each other that often I told the host and thanked her for their patients. Sat us down enjoyed a great meal and the staff heard we were celebrating Father's Day and brought over a dessert for us to enjoy. Appreciated all that the staff did to make this night an experience that I will always remember."

The soup AND salad starter was nice, plus the sides are big enough to share between four people so that you get to try a variety of items. The prime rib was prepared in a nice, tasty way and we were each pleased with our pieces of meat. We are tempted to go back to try the specialty Wagyu beef, which is very pricey. But we'd like to try it for the experience! Desserts are unique and tasty, too. We had very good attentive service, as well."

I was thinking I would order the Japanese Kobe steak, but I was not prepared to pay $140 for just the entree.  So I ordered the prime rib and it was just fine."

We got the A5 experience, which came with 4 different cuts of grade A5 wagyu beef. The meal is served ala carte so will have to order your sides separately. We ordered the mash potatoes with caramelized bacon and mac & cheese, it was fantastic. I would recommend this place if you are going out for a special occasion. Awesome food, great service a total package experience!!!"

Thank you June, for making the evening comfortable for us and assisting us with the projector to make it even more special.

Little do I know the menu was selectively created by the executive chef of Alexander's Steakhouse. Even better! What stood out to me was that my party and I arrived a tad bit late, considering our reservation time was the latest you can set it to. As soon as I entered I was amazed at how lovely the restaurant looked. Totally better than the pictures on yelp for sure.  The staff were very energetic and pleased to be taking care of my party. The host and servers were very accommodating and made sure I had a birthday that I would never forget. Everything was onpoint, from the drinks that were recommended, to every bit of detail on the main courses.  The food sure was quality you can taste and not to mention the dessert which included these fudge bars which were on the house. Dining here is very affordable and a great place to go on a date on or celebrate anniversaries. I will definitely be coming back with more company. Thank you 5A5 Steak Lounge <3"

Asked for another table.  \"I'll have to check with the front.\"  Okayed by front.  Walked us 3' feet to other side of dividing wall.  Table for 2.  We'd like a table away from this area.  \"I'll have to check with the front.\"  Back again.  As we walk towards back, we see an empty section with 6 or 7 tables for 2 to 4.  May we sit here.  Yes, and gestured to a table for 2.  May we sit side by side at a banquet table set for 3.  \"We use this table for 3.\"  Yes, but we would like to sit next to each other, we have some business to discuss.  \"I'll have to check with the front.\"  Okay, but we'll sit down here while we wait.  Disappeared down a passage opposite the \"front\" into a side room; never seen again.  From then was served by a pleasant and efficient waiter.  When leaving 2 hours later, not a single, twosome, threesome or foursome were in our section.  Guests with reservations, arriving on time should feel welcome, not an annoyance for expecting a good table or for thinking we're as important as the guests who \"may arrive later,\" nor immediately shown to a table that should be held until full or for guests without reservations.  It's called hospitality and that's the business you're in!"

We were seated and then our waiter Ryan came to the table- he immediately began to stare at my girlfriend in a very blatant and overt way. He left to get us water and when he came back my girlfriend asked him about the wine list- this whole time he acted like i didn't exist. My girlfriend asked about a particular wine - she was holding the wine list- Ryan (the waiter) then acted like he could find the wine on the list- he ran his finger up and down the list and then ran his finger over my girlfriend's finger as she was holding the wine list- he did it not once but twice-BTW the wine she was asking about was easily found on the list. A real creeper- he made our anniversary dinner a very uncomfortable evening- the restaurant is fine- just keep your date  away from Ryan!"

We go there at least 2-4 times a year expecting and finding much satisfaction in their service, decor, and more than anything, their prime rib (with or without bone in)  is the best, moist, tender, flavorful, cook to your specification (mind was a perfect medium).  I have had their NY cut, it is sooo good, it did not need the toppings!  I always have them put them as a side.  Side to must have are Truffle Mac n Cheese, Cream Spinach, and oh yeah Mash Potatos!  Extras?  Try the Tempora Lobster.  Had this for the first time yesterday as a comp (due to their generous hospitality - our order was delayed due to the rush of patrons).  Delicious, not because it was a comp, it was just that good!  Plans to go back at any excuse to eat out. If you are think about trying 5a5, don't think, just try!  Won't regred it."

My girlfriend and I took several minutes to savor every piece. Order the sauce on the side, not event slightly needed.Leila is a wonderful and delightful server who was SO attentive and full of recommendations. At one point,  I even asked myself \"have I drank any water?\" because my glass was filled to the brim.To top it off, the owner, Steven,  introduced himself to us personally and gave us certified Wagyu cards full of information about the steer including location, age, weight, name, etc.What a delightful evening."

The preparation was poor with inadequate color outside, and the steak was covered in a ridiculous sauce that you might expect from TGIF or Outback. Not impressed at all. Every steak comes with some kind of topping. High quality meat doesn't deserve this kind of treatment. Service was not impressive. Wrong drink order, wine took forever to be served (as in I ordered it at the same time as dinner and it was served after finishing my salad (which was a mediocre wedge). The sides were ok but again not special. This place is not a great steak house. Decent only."

The food was amazing from the melt-in-your-mouth filet mignon to the free range chicken. The potatoes au gratin were fabulous and we thorougly enjoyed all the delicious palate cleansers presented in between, a surprise treat. They brought out a lovely piece of  almond cake decorated with Happy Birthday at the end of our meal.Our server Jason was attentive and quietly took care of a wine mishap on our bill. We were pleasantly surprised at the reasonable prices, although you can spend much more on the Wagyu beef. The space has a luxury lounge vibe with live piano music and great conversation which can get a bit noisy but is part of the fun. We would highly recommend coming here for a special occasion or to impress a business client."

Our waitress was super friendly and helpful - we had let them know when booking that we couldnt have dairy or wheat and everyone had been briefed which is always reassuring for us. The menu was also adaptable on ordering - also a big plus for us.Portions are huge, quality is excellent - my only mild gripe would be not being able to get a standard cocktail that wasnt on menu - definitely not a dealbreaker when everything else was so lovely. We aslo appreciated the muted music and being able to hear each other speak! I can wholeheartedly recommend, especially if you have special dietary requirements."

We have  young adult kids and we were looking for a fun place to celebrate a birthday - and this was the perfect spot.  The steaks were high quality and well prepared, the sides were delicious, and the service was exceptional from start to finish.  The cocktails were creative and exceptional.  Best of all, the ambiance was perfect.  It has a great lounge feel, the table arrangements are perfect for conversation and well spaced from one another to allow for a sense of privacy, and the lighting was fun and modern while being warm.  There was a piano player at the front of the restaurant, far enough from the tables to allow for conversation - and he played a great variety of music that everyone enjoyed, regardless of age.  Overall, this was a great night, and the restaurant concept and service contributed immensely."

Flavor was impressive and amount of food to price ratio was awome.the resturant is a bit on the pricey side but worth it hands down. I will definitely return for another visit.Look out New York, San Francisco has a contender for best steak house in my opinion."

Our dinning experience was great; we had dinner reservations at 5:30 when the restaurant opens, it was a Thursday evening an not very busy when we arrived, however, became more vibrate by the time we left at 7pm.  Our service was great, menu was explained, we were brought our \"Chef Treats\", a complementary tasting of something that was really good:)  My daughter ordered the 6oz Petite and it was perfect, I ordered the 15oz Prime Rib which was huge, I was unable to finish.....in addition we had two sides; the Bacon Mash Potatoes and the Macaroni and Cheese...both great.  I had two glasses of wine, our server was very descriptive about what wines I was ordering which is always nice.  We finished our dinner off with a great desert.  If you are looking for a great place to have a nice dinner, I would definitely recommend the Steak Lounge!!  I will be bringing my wife here, I think she was a little jealous about what a wonderful time my daughter and I had:)"

You would think they would have enough to last until at least 9pm but who knows, I guess it was really THAT popular. Tried the lobster tempura - Awesome. The truffle fries were OK, only because they were tiny pieces so it seemed like it we got the bottom of the batch of fries. Filet minon and boneless ribeye were very delicious nonetheless."

The staff was understanding that we were a few minutes late. The waiter was very knowledgeable and gave us enough time to figure out what we wanted and picked up our cues when we were ready to order. We tried the Hamachi and Oyster starter and they were delicious. We also had the Lobster Tempura which was also outstanding! Since it was our anniversary we went for the A5 Experience and we were not disappointed! Going through the 4 cuts of meat they really did get softer and softer, butterier and butterier. To end the evening 5A5 gave us a nice little dessert with a beautifully decorated plate to commemorate our anniversary. Will definitely go back again to try more of the delicious dishes!"

The Wagyu beef is probably spectacular, but it's SUPER expensive.  The level of obnoxious, pounding music made ordinary conversation impossible.  I understand that 5A5 probably isn't catering to a middle-aged crowd, so I guess normal conversation is not high on their priorities.  But if you like a $500 steak without being able to converse, this is your place."

The beat salad, lobster tail tempura, truffle fries, and tempura peppers were awesome. The wagyu steak, while pricey at >130 for four ounces, was INCREDIBLE (and worth it). The only thing we weren't impressed with was the Brussels sprouts, which were a bit mushy, but the phenomenal service more than made up for it (our server even removed them from our bill without our asking)."

A5 Ribeye Miyazaki Wagyu beef, the 10oz. Filet mignon, & an order of the macaroni & cheese topped with pieces of lobster tail. Both meats came out at the same time to differentiate the types of cut. Now I thought I had been eating the top choice whenever I would order the Filet mignon wherever I would go. This Filet mignon tasted like a regular Safeway steak compared to the A5 ribeye. So much flavor, super tender & juicy its a WOW type of flavor. The macaroni was exquisite & how could I forget about the amazing bacon bread! Super pricey but It's worth every bite! this place deserves 5 stars!"

Manhattan much better for a similar price. Waiter was great. Valet was asleep. Staff happy and personable.But a \"tasting\" plate of steak of four 4oz cuts for $525?? For $525 I want much more than a \"taste\". Rib Eye was just \"okay\". I don't usually go to a high end restaurant for mac and cheese, but it was a side recommended by the waiter.Had a great weekend in San Francisco. Would have been nice to say I had a great meal. A bit noisy. A 30th Birthday Party was next to us. Would have thought it was a 16th by the way they yelled and carried on."

We got the truffle fries and lobster tempura for an appetizer and both were amazing.  In fact all the food we had was amazing except for the steak oddly enough.  Sides and desserts were good, but the steak was nothing special especially for a place that calls itself a steak lounge.  My steak was covered in a bacon jam that overpowered the taste of the steak and the steak itself was a little tough and chewy.  Not bad, by any means, just not as good as I had hoped for."

The hamachi appetizer was amazing, and the chef even send out a little sample for you to try. It was a true 5 course meal that did not leave you wanting to take a nap. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a true dining experience. (Note: the noise level isn't a fair rating because the Giants had just won the World Series and everyone was watching/listening to the game on their phones. I would sumise that it is a very quiet dining room on a regular night)."

Rushing customers is all-too-common in the US (and I've been a waiter, so, yes, I understand the logic of turning tables). However, at $225/person before tip, such behavior is simply unacceptable."

In this instance, price was of no conern to us. We were celebrating and ready to enjoy every moment. Upon arrival, the hostess was welcoming and provided exceptional attention. She greated us enthusiastically, took our coats and seated us promptly. Once seated, our waiter was beyond expectations! He spent extra time explaining the menu, walking us through the Waguy beef raising process, provided us with options that were not only sharable, but patron favorites. He was constantly checking on us, refilling beverages often and made the entire experience worth every dime!"

The atmosphere was nice, the service was good, but the filet was a bit tough. For the price, I expect it to be at least as good as what I cook at home, and it just wasn't. It wasn't a bad experience, but not a memorable one and I wouldn't likely return again in the future."

The meat was salted, nicely grilled to bring out a strong flavor of the steak, and the sauce over the steak was a nice complement and did not mask/overpower the steak.  I requested medium rare and they brought it out a bit too raw, but better this way than overdone and just had them fire it up a bit more.  As I said, I prefer a filet to avoid the chewy parts that other cuts of meat have.  5A5 did a good job, but did not convince me to convert to a T-bone nor porterhouse.  Next time, I'll try the filet and hope that the grilling and dry aging process is the same."

I ordered a 26oz bone in ribeye and it was horrible I can make it better in my own frying pan (which says a lot)      I would never recommend this place to anyone.,"

We ordered the truffle fries with the sriracha aioli, the A5 experience for the entree with the potato au gratin for the side dish, and the sorbet tasting and opera cake per waitress' suggestion. The beef from the A5 experience was very tender and flavorful. The potato au gratin was a great compliment.

The food was excellent, I had lamb chops the others prime rib.  The setting was great for conversation and an overall relaxing locale.  I especially enjoyed the timing of the course service, they were not rushed nor did they drag.  It was what fine dining should be, enjoyable conversation with the service just being part of the experience.  While some may be concerned about the prices, we felt they were comparable with fine dining in San Francisco. Well worth the time and would recommend 5A5 for special night out."

The food was fantastic!  Would highly recommend 5A5 for dinner.In the lounge the piano player's song selections (at the time we were there 6:30 PM) were really fast and loud, a little too much for dinner ambiance.  His selections improved later.  we joked that he must be paid by the number of songs he played.  It actually had a few of us on edge!"

We ordered the 4oz Wagyu fillet and 4oz Wagyu rib cap, both were about $34 per oz, so be prepared to shell out some cash.  We loved both of the cuts, they were amazingly tender, flavorful and melt in your mouth.  We also had the truffle Mac and cheese, which was rich, creamy and delightful.  The Brussels spouts were also one of out favorite items of the night.  We finished the meal by sharing the peach tea dessert.  We don't drink alcohol so we both ordered water.  This place was great but for the almost $500 bill we expected the service to be a little more attentive and the experience to be a little more special."

The resturant created a wonderful dessert for us. I had a very romantic dinner. The 2nd time is when I tell my friends/co-workers how great my first experience was, we decided to come back to celebrate a promotion here. The food we ordered for both time are all amazing yummy! I tried their F-5 fillet the firs time and really liked it. The 2nd time, I ordered Slow roasted prime rib, it was very juicy. The staffs all have beautiful smiles and the services they provided was five star. I highly recommended this place to anyone who has a special occasion and looking for some of the best food/steak in town."

The Filet Mignon was like butter. We all ordered different steaks and they all had unique flavours. Quite an achievement. The side dishes are big enough for a family of four. Truffled mac & cheese is quite delicious. A nice twist to an old favourite. Leave room for desert. The wagyu sliders are great for two - and gives you a taste of the wagyu without having to pay a fortune (market rates)."

Our table was small and away from the ambiance. I asked if we could move to a bigger table and be seated in the booth area, central to the ambiance. The staff made it happen and we were pleased. Our service was exceptional, very personal. The Wagyu was AMAZING. Every bite melted in my mouth. The dessert, almond cake was superb. The entire experience deserves a 10 star rating."

It all works but the food is not for me unfortunately. I've had the bone-in ribeye and the bone-in NY... def have had better elsewhere. I also think I caught them on a bad night as it was almost impossible to flag someone down for water, hot water, the check... The 3 women ordered petit filets of varying degrees of doneness and all got the wrong ones.... doesn't sound like a horrible mistake but dim lighting meant no one noticed until after several bites in at which point they didn't feel like switching.

As a matter of fact, we shared the \"5A5 Experience\".  Everything was really outstanding.  The service, the salad, the side dish, even our table neighbors who became our new best friends when our entree arrived!  And Wagyu beef is the most amazing food on the planet.  Our server was friendly and helpful with suggestions, and we enjoyed the ambiance too.  Not super loud, but not what you would call a private romantic environment.  Overall, we enjoyed it immensely and we look forward to visiting again."

The seared scallops were excellent as well, chimichurri & trout roe with pickled carrots really add an interesting flare to the dishFor my main I had dry aged bone-in ny 22oz w/bacon jam, sous vide \u201cperfect\u201d egg. Mix the yolk with the bacon jam & take a bite of this perfectly cooked steak. Order medium as they tend to lean to the medium rare side anyway. Finished w/4 oz. 50/50 F1 Tajima Filet.

This throws my son completely off and even his girlfriend's father was laughing because my son was blushing!  We had a  scrumptious dinner! For dessert, Lynn served my son a special dessert with a chocolate icing that say \"If you like this, you better put a ring on it!\" The food, the atmosphere and Lynn's playfulness made this a wonderful evening that we will not forget!"

The entire meal from the Wagyu Tartare and beef sashimi to the bone in aged NY to sides and dessert were excellent. Nice wine list too. The service was outstanding from the moment we walked into the restaurant. The atmosphere was very nice and relaxed and made for a great dining experience."

The ultra modern decor is not to my taste, but then so little is.  Go for the food.  They import genuine Wagu and Kobe beef, and their domestic beef is Angus.  My T-bone was underdone but fine, so order one step more done than you really want.  Extra friendly and efficient staff.  They called 2 days in advance to confirm our reservation, and asked for any food allergies or sensitivities-- then the waitress repeated back what I told the caller and advised against certain selections.  What a great service.  I was impressed."

She was knowledgeable with the menu, gave great recommendations, and was very welcoming and attentive. Phenomenal service.The only bad part of our dinner was the food runner who took and boxed our food. He tried to carry all the plates, and in doing so, stacked a plate right on top of our creamed spinach that was going to be boxed up! When we got our boxed food back, we realized he had thrown away my bone from my ribeye. There was still meat on the bone and I was looking forward to eating it at home! Also, he threw away what was left of our mac & cheese, which my girlfriend was looking forward to eating too. :("

Yellow, almost rotting lettuce. The manager took it away, but the one he brought to replace it was not much better.Brussel Sprouts, which the server recommended, were horrendous.4 ounce Tajima F1 filet, medium rare, was nearly inedible.

The Prime Rib was excellent and so was the Ribeye. The restaurant was not too noisey, and we were able to have a nice conversation without being drowned out by the other patrons."

My Son's bone-in rib-eye was huge and cooked just the right way, which is difficult because the thickness of the steak itself! and my wife's three small plates; tuna tataki, wagyu sashimi and lobster tempura was great, especially the lobster tempura that cannot be cooked any better; crunchy on the outside yet juicy on the inside!

The $200 Wagyu steaks were not in the budget, but the \"regular\" ribeye was among the best I have had - great sear/crust, sauce, sides.  Everyone in my party (work colleagues) left happy.Hope to return soon!"

What a pleasant evening with excellent service and great food. I'll be bringing friends to 5A5 again."

My companion and I each ordered a flight (three 1oz shots), one from the US and one from Japan.  The wait staff was very attentive and friendly without being overbearing, the ambiance leans towards trendy (flashy lights), and the chef sent out a couple tidbits to whet the appetite.  Would definitely dine here again."

The staff was excellent from the front door to the Matre D usering us out and telling us what direction we should take for our walk home.Food was exceptional from the 3 different cuts of beef to the all of the extras. Spinach, Mac & cheese, mashed potatoes and on and on. These were the moderately priced steaks in difference to the 5A steaks on the left side of the menu. Service was the BEST. Jake deserves an award besides his gratuity.The lounge and the Neil Young lookalike piano player was a hit. One glass of port became 3 glasses, and a whole lot of 60 & 70's music leaving just a great spot in our hearts for A5A ."

He was very surprised being served with a special dessert at the end for his recognition. A few things to improve.1) The table is leveled too high at the center section. I felt like a kid, eating with arms held high.2) The music from the pianist was too loud. I hope softer music was played.Other than that, it was great. I will definitely come back to treat my friends out."

The food all had great flavor, but our meat and veggies were a bit underdone for our taste (fleshy center for medium rare & al dente brussel sprouts).  Since we were incredibly full from our appetizers and other side dishes, we were perfectly content with eating the edges of our filet and ribeye, and took leftovers home.  The service was GREAT!  From the moment we were greeted, to our servers attention, to the support staff clearing our dishes, filling our water and checking in on us.  Don't expect to have an intimate conversation, but do expect to have a fun, lively dining experience."

The atmosphere was comfortable and not pretentious.  Delicious food, generous portions, appropriate seasoning and just the right temperature.  I had a Wagyu steak for my birthday and while it was pricey it was worth cost. $$$ My second visit saw me ordering grilled chicken.  The menu is simple and most items are affordable.  The staff was very accommodating and even flagged a taxi for me as I hurried to the theater.  Give 5A5 a chance, I'm going back soon!"

They cooked our steaks wrong and then when they came out with the new ones they must have been out of sauces because my steak had almost no demi glaze or tarragon beurre fondue but they tried to cover it up with the herb salad. They tried to make it up to us with free desert and only made us wait 30 minutes for it. This place is a joke and they treated us poorly because we where from out of town. The manager told me he had never seen so many things go wrong in his 30 years in the business. Then comped us one app and desert that took 30 minutes that we didn't even want."

The maitre d' seemed out of place here: an older gentleman from an old, stuffy restaurant. However, it is further from the truth. The maitre d' greeted you warmly upon entering. The waiter service was impeccable. He and his assistant were very knowledgeable and attentive, but not overbearing. The food and presentation were very good. Typical steakhouse pricing where everything is a la carte. What really surprised me was, upon leaving, the maitre d' thanked me by name, and made a comment about and remembered the brief conversation we had with him when he first seated us. Now that's service."

The place quickly began to fill up, but the service didn't get distracted at all. The staff was very welcoming, and each person addressed by name the entire night and never stopped paying attention to the table, even when every other table was occupied. The cuisine looked like art, and everything was delicious! The Chef sent us 3 special \"tastes\" gratis. I was glad that the appetizer portions were small, because we wanted to order 3 courses. The best appetizer on the menu is the Mac n Cheese with lobster. I could have been content just eating this all night. The steaks came out perfect, dessert was spectacular"

I had a late dinner there with my wife and everything from the ambience, the service and the food was outstanding.  The interior space was warm and inviting.  The tables are a mix of couches and chairs and made for an interesting layout leaving enough to know you're in a restaurant but still have that intimate feel with your dinner party.  The service from our waitress was very good.  She kept us well informed of the dishes and made a few suggestions which we selected.  The food was incredible.  We enjoyed the bites and appetizers and our steaks were cooked to medium rare perfectly.  Overall, it was a great dining experience and a night to remember."

Several of us had the same comment, everything was really good but what's the deal with the odd \"jams\" and sauces on the steaks? Frankly, if you are ordering a NY strip, you want to taste the steak, not the peculiar jams/sauces. Waiter gave us a tip to next time request them on the side or order without as he hears that \"quite a bit\" as to the steak. Likely some will like the unique preparation approach but for a traditionalist looking for a new steak place for a go to place (outside of the classic's we can all count on but you can access them just about everywhere of any demographic density) in S.F., not sure this is it."

The wagu beef app was amazing, the steak preparations were both interesting and added to the taste of the beef in place of overpowering it.  My only meal issue was the creamed spinach...not really creamed spinach...good but not the steakhouse classic.  The dessert was a tobacco ice cream served in a sazerac  cocktail...just amazing....really.  And then the scotch cart...makes my heart go pitter patter again just thinking about it...Seriously, worth the experience.   Great food and a great time."

Loud but not obnoxiously so. The food was average. My steak was over done, not med rare as ordered, and not the best quality. They tout the Waygu beef at exorbitant prices but their \"normal\" priced cuts were below average, in our humble opinion."

Actually, not big, and I really appreciated the 6oz option on the filet mignon and the 4 oz strip.  I love red meat, but I don't want a lot in a sitting these days.  While the steaks and presentation of their phenomenal meat is impressive, no need to be vetting your guests before coming here.  We had fish bites, octopus salad, tuna first, and it was all so fresh and divine.  Chef shares upon seating and the palate cleanser part was through, very nice touches."

They should also be mindful of customers who is bringing in a very special purse (birkin- attending a gallery event).

Our food server was perfect in her timing and execution, all the while unassuming, attentive, friendly and cordial.  During dinner I drank more than 12 glasses of water since I had a few cocktails at HH earlier and my water glass was never empty.  Most of the food servers and all the bartenders are super.  I've never had a mediocre experience, and recommend this restaurant to everyone who enjoys good food!"

I took my boyfriend here for a surprise birthday dinner, every staff member made sure to wish him a happy birthday. They also brought him out a special dessert, a mini strawberry short cake, with \"Happy Birthday Josh\" written out it chocolate. It was really special.  The meal was great as well.  We had a feast of brussel sprouts, lobster mac n' cheese, half and half wagyu steak and a filet.  Everything was mouth watering.  Three days later, I am still thinking about the lobster mac and bacon bread.  If you are looking for a great dining experience, with great food with powerful flavors, and a place with great ambiance and service - go to 5A5."

Once seated into the dining area we were quickly greeted by our waiter. Since this was our first experience here, he presented us with a quick review the selected beef and a complete review of the menu.We selected the Tuna Tataki of tandoori spice, watermelon, herb puree, candied bacon since the watermelon with tuna combination intrigued us. It was a refreshing bite of wonderful. Main courses were filet mignon, boneless ribeye steak with sides of potatos au gratin & brussell sprouts. Steaks were perfectly rested before presentation to us and the sides were piping hot."

Very comfortable seating and service was pretty on point, but not 5 stars worthy imo. Nice range of steak, but a little shocked that you only have Wagyu or A5 choices then a complete step-down to \"Choice\" steaks. 5A5 you should have some \"Prime\" in there especially if you are going to offer dry aged on the menu. A standout here were the side dishes. Brussel sprouts, mac n cheese, truffle fries, and oh yes the hamachi small bite all went fast. Would recommend to anyone who wants a good steak dinner, but not necessarily the same old scene."

Nevertheless, we've been completely ignored for the first 10 minutes.Our main waiter was friendly but completely impersonal. He didn't even try to have a small talk with us, just took our order and left quickly.The food was good, the truffle fries were amazing but overall the place does not have a good vibe. It's quite soul-less, and lacks on personality that could distinguish it from other places. Being in San Francisco the fact that the food was good is not enough to stand out. There are many other places with great food in the city."

Sides we went with string beans and brussel sprouts, again, both good.The gem on the menu that we didn't touch was the Kobe beef at $35-40 an ounce. I hope to be back at some point to try it, and they did have a sampler of all 4 varieties at $525 for 16 ounces of meat. Worth it? Unknown yet.Only negative I would say would be the overall time it took to get our meal out. It took in excess of 40 minutes for our meal (which they did warn us before hand though)Definitely recommended for a special occasion or meat quenching visit."

We began with a delicious shrimp appetizer then sampled an American filet mignon, which was quite delicious. However, when our wagyu beef A5 \"experience\" arrived, I never imagined the gift I was about to present to my tastebuds. Unbelievable. There was absolutely no comparison to the regular steak. Pricey and certainly best kept for special occasions, but do yourself a favor and treat yourself to this menu.

My steak was tasty although slightly cooked beyond medium rare and a bit over sauced. I recommend if you get any steak, have them put the sauce on the side and get it done one less temp than they recommend, for medium rare, order rare. Service was friendly and attentive. The wine list is manageable and has many interesting choices. They have a sommelier so take advantage of his knowledge of the wine list. The check is not for the faint of heart. Taking full advantage of the dining experience here will set you back $200/person+ with tax, tip, license and doc fee. All in all a really nice dining experience."

We have a 6 oz count to share which was perfect for us.All 5 of our senses left happy (the \"5\" in 5 A5), and while we did not try the A5 qualify beef (a tad pricey for our wallet), we loved what we did get.Bill"

Certainly the attraction of this place, and on that front, 5A5 delivers an A5.Service and seating a notch off the highest echelon. Some accompaniments forgotten and occasional plates were delivered without any comment except, \"plates are really hot.\"Also, arrived at early seating but placed in awkward dark back corner, which was soon filled with an 8 top of loud and profane male diners (bachelor party?). Really dampened the atmosphere."

Everything was perfection from the moment I dropped my car with the valet, who was so helpful and remembered that I would be back with some packages prior to my reservation and he ran up to me and offered to carry them and put them away for me. The Maitre' d was charming, kind, and very attentive having our coats ready for us when we went to leave. The space is gorgeous in a modern and retro way. Young cool and hip but not in an irritating way (if you are not that young). The food innovative and delicious with a wide range of offerings - including the specialty drinks which are worth a try even though they sound a little strange. We skipped dessert but we couldn't have eaten another bite anyway."

For entrees we had the rib eye and the lamb chops with shards & mushrooms as our sides. Everything was mouth-watering good - all of it was cooked to perfection.For dessert, we shared an tobacco ice cream which sounds strange but was indescribably delicious - you have to try it!.

Vibrant lights, crocodile texture lounge chairs and a modern rotunda with pastel lighting. 2). The food was crazy good. I had the 10 oz prime rib and it melted in my mouth. My partner had the flier and he loved it. Our sides, were the mac and cheese and chard. IT WAS FLIPPING GREAT!!!! Oh by the way....Bacon bread. Ever had it? I didn't until our dinner. Wow is all I have to say. 3). Service was great. We were celebrating a Birthday and our waitress was great. She went over the menu, made great recommendations and had a \"Happy Birthday\" plate sent over at the end of our dinner. A great experience and will return!"

The kitchen and the pastry chef was also kind in sending our table a few small bites as palate cleansers which added a lot to the experience. Food was moderate for the price, but the overall experience was very positive and would recommend 5A5 to anyone who can afford it."

We started with the hamachi bites which were amazing, then split a heirloom tomato salad which was simple yet perfectly done. I had the bone in ribeye and my girlfriend had the duo of lamb, both were cooked perfectly and tastes amazing. And the truffle mac on the side, to die for. Our server was also awesome, it took her a minute to get to our table but once she came it was like she could read our minds about what we wanted/ needed. We will definitely be back to 5A5, and next time will have to get the wagyu."

Hostess said Happy Birthday to us, but towards the end of the dinner, while all the other bday tables got a nice dessert plate, all we got was the bill. To make matters worse, our waiter gave us the wrong dessert wine and charged us more for the one we got. He didn't even apologize or offer to give us the other one in exchange for his own error. To add to our bad experience, service was rather slow. I spent three hours in the restaurant. They were not busy to be lacking the service I expected and to charge a premium for everything when the food was just okay. I will be going to another steakhouse in the future."

The rest of the meal was above average though you can probably find better individual dishes (e.g., HOPR for prime rib). The service was incredible and made the meal more memorable. Not a restaurant to go everyday though certainly for special occasions or when the mood strikes for a fancy night out."

Fusion that could use taste profile editing(pasty amuse bouches,hamachi \"Bite\" overpowered by seasoning,but lovely presentation).- To Food enthusiast who understand dry aged beef, wagyu, California cuisine: this is probably a lower end restaurant list option. $40-200/steak: Steak 1 ordered medium rare,arrived medium well. 2nd steak ordered well arrived slightly rare. For the price you pay go to something like Alexanders, Lawry, Harris for better food quality.-Waited 30mins for our steaks after addtnl 20 mins for appetizers(restaurant was qtr filled @arrival, bar tables served appetizers before us); Very loud, appropriate for upscale bar/lounge ambiance, no separate dining area from bar folks, tables not cleared."

The rest of our dinners (filet mignon and prime rib) were delicious as were the appetizers and between course tidbits to freshen our palates and expand our tasteslIt was pricey but a memory I'll cherish."

Decor itself was nicely set and had a great transition from the doorway to the sitting area, had a very vibrant touch to it. Food was flavorful and exciting, the heirloom tomato salad was fantastic to start with since it was light and refreshing which got us ready for the prime rib and the boneless ribeye. Both were cooked to perfection and was very tender, we enjoyed our steaks with the truffle fries and sriracha aioli . A great combination for a complete meal! But what really caught us was the service, Meghan was a delight and was very knowledgable about the menu."

The jasmine chicken was the BEST chicken I have had! I don't eat pork or beef, so finding a place that can make chicken interesting is difficult. Most places just don't focus on other meat options outside of beef or pork. But 585 has mastered chicken! The chicken was moist and the flavor was so delicious! I also loved their Lobster Tempura. Yum! Their truffle fries were the only thing I wasn't impressed with. The flavor was bland and the dipping sauce just tasted like mayo. I also wish they had more vegetable sides that didn't include bacon."

The first thing I noticed was the booth couch was so low, I could have eaten of the plate without much effort. And then it was noisy. Several times I couldn't hear our waiter.The \"Bites\" of tuna sounded really interesting but there wasn't as much \"taste\" as I had hoped. The truffle fries were very good, crispy and with a nice aioli dipping sauce. I ordered the boneless ribeye, my guest ordered the prime rib. Both came as ordered. The meat was very tender but both were poorly seasoned (in my opinion). After the initial hint of seasoning there was just the taste of meat - not bad but now the \"taste sensation\" I was expecting - for what it cost."

However, I would not want to take, to the restaurant, a friend I hadn't seen in a while. The noise level at 7:00 on a Thursday night calls for nearly shouting to one another during the most excellent meal. This is not the place for a quiet, romantic special occasion dinner."

I had the dry aged NY, which I had a hard time believing it was actual dry aged prime beef (not to be a snob but I've had my share of steaks at high end joints to know the difference). My wife had the waygu NY and it also was disappointing (and yes we've had our share of waygu in the past as well). They smother all of their steaks with one sauce or another, which should have been the first sign of the pending disappointment. If you have a high quality cut, you don't need to or want to mask the flavor of the beef. Enough said...The service was great and the ambience was decent. It was loud but we knew that before going."

My Cesar salad that was quite good, and my wife's oyster bite and a hamachi bite were served on spoons and were tasty.. We shared the \"shrooms\"-- a delightful medley of mushrooms that were delicious. The dry aged 22 oz. t-bone steak for me, and my wife had the 4 ounce New York. The meat is strictly ala carte. The New York was tiny. The filet side of my steak was tender; the sirloin side tough. The sauces made up for the lack of taste in the steak. If you go there, bite the bullet and try the Waygu. 2 glasses of wine and 2 whiskeys plus the food: $177 before tip."

We were tempted to get the Wagyu steaks because they look so good, but too bad the price tag was a little too expensive for us. We ended up getting ribeye steaks and aged T-bone, everything was wonderful. I am only giving 3 star for service because I noticed the waiter was nicer to the couple sitting at the table next to us than to our table, what's up with that? And also they charged us for still water.... if we knew still water cost money we would've chose tap water."

We decided to look it up online and we liked what we saw (we were in the mood for steak), so we gave it a shot. We were very pleased with the steak lounge concept and it was complimented by spectacular service. The waitress was extremely knowledgeable about the menu and treated us as if we were the only people in the restaurant. The food was spectacular! Possibly the best meat we've ever had. It was a pricy joint but for the high quality of the meat and the fact that it is a steakhouse, it was well worth it's value. Next time we come to the city we will definitely stop by 5A5. Two thumbs up!"

We did not expect a nice piece of aged NY steak needs to re-cook. When a steak is sent back for undercook, I would expect a new piece done right. Re-cooking it and serve it again totally ruin the texture. The Japanese waygu beef with the chunk of cold butter was so big that ruin the temperature - the medium-rare piece was so cold like rare. Service is slow, waited 25 minutes before the bread basket was served. Order the Hamachi bite and it did not show till after the second appetizer. This is not what you expected from a steakhouse. They tried to make it up toward the end of dinner, unfortunately it was too late."

Once we were at our table we were served water and bread, and our order was taken promptly by our waiter. Over the course of our dinner, I've noticed that the floor manger was greeting the table around us but never came to ours. He greeted them once they were seated, and again to pour them water and wine. Not even once did he say hi or looked in our direction. He then finally came to our table to greet us goodbye. Then I thought to myself, maybe the reason why he didn't stop by our table is because we didn't order a bottle of wine or a fancy glass of water. Go figure!!!"

However, I need to make a special comment about how professional the waitstaff are, from folks bringing bread and water, to the server to the maitre 'd. In many restaurants today, the waitstaff are either almost non-existent, or too \"in your face.\" Here, they wade sure to take care of you while allowing you to fully enjoy your dining companions and the excellent food at your own pace. Outstanding service!"

I thought the price four two people was reasonable, considering where we were, the quality of the food and they did not charge us corkage. I had prime rib and my guest had a filet. We agreed they were the best we'd had in quite some time. The lobster tempura was unique and delicious. The sides were both very good."

The prices are expensive but the experience made our last night in San Francisco memorable"

Here are what we ordered: French onion soup - fair. Lobster Miso Soup - too salty. Wagu beef sashimi - fair, not much taste. Both dry-aged NY strip and dry aged t bone were super salty with the sauce all over the steak. The sauces were totally over powering the meat. Creamy spinach and mushroom as side dishes were also fair. Overall, nothing positive from the food that stood out for us, especially for a well known steak house. The service was not genuine at all. The waiter came to ask us how we are doing because he felt he has to ask. Won't go back there for steaks!"

Located a few blocks from the Embracadero, this is a true star in the San Francisco dining scene. Billed as a \"steak lounge\", it has a slight Vegas feel to it in terms of decor and style. The cocktail menu was interesting and Alana behind the bar was up to the challenge when asked to come up with something not on the menu. Table service was classy, prompt, and quietly professional; the wait staff complemented the meal rather than being a distraction. The meal was, without a doubt, one of the most enjoyable in recent memory anywhere I've traveled. From the hamachi \"bite\" to start the meal to the prime rib, awesome."

Great variety on the menu make this a step up from your standard steakhouse (although if you order chicken or the veggie plate, you might be wasting your money here), and the service is attentive without being unctuous. Terrific filet mignon and the usual interesting assortment of sides, all a la carte, with a large wine list and creative desserts. Best of all, since we'd included the info that it was our anniversary, they brought us a lovely plate with a beautiful message and a little fig cake -- so sweet!"

The sides are fabulous- especially the truffle mac and cheese with lobster accompaniment, and creamed spinach (old school with modern twist)...Salads are old school steak restaurant salads with a \"unique twist\" - different enough to differentiate 5A5 from the usual steak restaurants...Great experience."

I was hoping to admire it for a bit longer but oh well. Dinner was delicious, our server was amazing.

The restaurant's decor could some some updating and refreshing, including adding some noise seoftening elements. Loud noise bounced off the walls in the restaurant so much that my date and I wanted to leave as soon as possible (no dessert, no extra drink = revune lost for the business). Oh - and the seating was uncomfortable."

The first was a work dinner, this was a birthday dinner for my spouse.I wanted a place with a great lounge area and bar - this restaurant delivers on this.The food was fantastic. A great slightly Asian-influenced take on a stakehouse. Unique twists on dishes, but not to go to far as to be inaccessible to more traditional palates. The service in general (bartenders, hostess, wait staff) was very good, but our waitress was just good, not great. She never shared the specials (heard that from another waiter a table over an hour into our dinner), for example.The place is a bit noisy and the spacing is generous between seats, so it does allow for a louder environment, but not enough to stay away."

We arrived 15 minutes late and the host was still more than accommodating. We got a nice romantic seat for two and had a wonderful server! We ordered a reasonable priced Zinfandel and it went wonderful with our steaks! I got the 6oz filet and my boyfriend got the 22oz tbone! Both were phenomenal! I recommend if you can eat more than I do (I eat like a bird) then get the 10z, otherwise the 6 is a good size.The sides were great as well, we got macaroni and cheese and the Swiss chard. I would recommend those to anyone! In the end, they gave Tyler a free dessert and it tasted great! It was unnecessary but greatly appreciated!"

We had the smoked salmon pastrami which literally melted in your mouth. We both had filets for dinner - again - melt in your mouth tender and perfectly cooked - the beef and the sauce were a perfect pair. Sides were excellent as well: recommend the creamed spinach and truffled mac-n-cheese. The marbled potatoes were good, but a bit oily. Skip dessert - they were very small and were not very sweet - this is the one area where they could improve."

Splashed into the $14 shots of Orley & 209 gourmet gin."

Great ambiance and very romantic. My companion and I had a large \"booth\" to ourselves so we were able to sit next to each other and enjoy our perfect dinner and great wine. Just the right amount of food. Not too skimpy but not the steakhouse food coma effect afterwards either. We walked away feeling like we had an amazing dining experience, unique in the world, rather than just had another good steak. Would highly recommend from two people who have dined the world over and are very picky."

Our actual waiter - the one that took our order - let me wait for at least 8 minutes before he came over to see if I wanted water or anything else to drink (my dinner companion was late so I was sitting by myself). He also tried to be TOO nice. Absent that, dinner was good. I had the sliders and the beet salad and that was more than enough food - we shared a mac and cheese order. My companion did have dessert. Not sure I would go back on my own dime - but it's a great place to treat an important client."

It is very good: 4/5The service:Truly wonderful. I hesitated to take my boyfriend to Alexander's for his birthday despite the great steak reviews because some people had really bad experiences with snooty service. At 5A5, the waiters were really pleasing: they don't judge you for how much or what you order, they helpfully show you the 4 cuts of Wagyu meat, and the chef may surprise you with extra amazing dishes."

The fries were delicious, especially with the dipping sauce, but the steak seasoning and sauces were strange. It was a little sweet...yet sour, and overpowered the taste of the steak. A let-down.The small \"palate cleansers\" and free desserts were strange as well, often being too sweet or not sweet enough. Overall, the food was a tad disappointing, but the atmosphere and vibe of the restaurant was energetic and fun. 3/5."

They have a huge list of variety of great cuts and an assortment of Japanese Wagyu beef and Australian Wagyu which makes this place special.My wife and I ordered the Australian Wagyu filet mignon and New York cut. Both were cooked to perfection, flavorful, and juicy without fail. This is what we came in for! The service was spectacular, the ambiance was great with a pianist in the background, and the food knocked it out of the ballpark.Overall it was a fantastic place and would recommend to anyone who is celebrating a special occasion, romantic night out or for some who are just craving a great piece of steak."

The snooty hostess only open one side of the table. It wasn't like the place was packed. A waiter came later to extend the other side of the table. We ended up getting the Dine about Town meals. The clam chowder was over salted and my steak was cooked unevenly, however, it was a large portion. My friend did return her medium rare steak which came out medium. Our waitress was extremely accommodating and very concern about our degree of happiness. My other friend tried the wine pairing which he enjoyed quite a bit. Overall, I wasn't that impressed with the food."

We had the caesar salad as a starter, which was good, but probably had a little too much dressing on it. For our entree, we both chose the rib eye and that was fantastic! The meat was so juicy and tender and cooked to perfection. The mustard seeds on top were a great add as well. Lastly, the dessert was a trio of fondant, butterscotch tapioca (best I've ever had), and a chocolate passion fruit mousse. Overall, the experience was outstanding - the ambiance, the food, and the service. I would highly recommend 5A5 to family and friends."

We had the wine pairing with the DAT and it was worth every penny. The pinot grigio was incredibly crisp and refreshing paired with our bacon clam chowder soup. The red blend paired with our NY steak was also mouth watering. The NY steak was beautifully marbled and topped with carmelized onions and a bacon demi glaze. For dessert we had a muscat paired with a dessert trio of molten brown, tapioca and chocolate moouse that was amazing.The service and our server Leila was amazing.

Did Dine About Town menu and the Clam Chowder was outstanding buy my wife's Cod and my steak were really not to our liking. Steak had a lot of fat and I ordered medium but it came very rare. Waitress was less than friendly- not unfriendly - but kind of \"distant\". Had to pay for a side, marbled potatoes, even on the DAT menu. Marbled potatoes were like potatoe skins really but whole potatoes. Desert Trio was kind of \"iffy\" as well. Lounge next time."

Wine and cocktail list was poor. They could not make a Bloody Mary. We have participated in Dine About Town every year since it started and the last two years have been very disappointing. Participating restaurants have offered smaller portions and less desirable entrees and if this is the trend I think the program should be either discontinued or participating restaurants need to improve what they are offering. Some seem reluctant to offer the Dine About Town menu and they need to use this promotion to create new loyal customers and not drive them away!!"

While our reservation was for 5:30, our early arrival was accommodated without issue and welcomed. The evening started with a wondeful wine selection, followed by incredible food selections. We had the steak and with was top notch. Finished off with a wonderful desert for my birthday. Lynnette was an absolute treat to have as our server. We actually ordered a cheese plate to take back with us to our hotel, where we broke that at out for a nitecap at the bar....what a find. Thank you 5A5 for our evening."

We found the wait staff was attentive without being intrusive or hovering. I will say that upon leaving the hostess went far above and beyond to get us a cab on a difficult Friday night - running down the street and standing out in the cold to hail us a ride.The food was good but not notable. The romaine salad, their take on a Caesar, was bland with the lettuce luke warm. We had the boneless ribeye and a bone in NY, both medium. The steaks were prepared as requested - slightly red in the center but were unremarkably seasoned and very average tasting.In sum, cool d\u00e9cor but an average meal."

The request was met perfectly and set the tone for the evening. Our waitress, Leila, was knowledgable, attentive, and incredibly warm during the entire evening. We were given two or three plates, compliments of the chef, and the food was absolutely incredibly. We both got the filets and they were cooked perfectly, as were our other courses. The music in the background provided a wonderful setting without being overwhelming. I would recommend this restaurant without hesitation and will definitely be returning!"

They were very accommodating.I was surprised by the live pianist in the bar area and really enjoyed that while we waited for our whole party to gather.The waiter was spot on and easy going with a group so large. The food was good. A little pricey for a slightly above average meal. But, it was fun that it was well worth it!They even brought out a few extras for the table to nibble on. Plus they brought bday treats with candles!"

The menu did not have enough options for me in terms of the non-entrees. The food was very good but our experience was definitely soured by the CONSTANT interruptions from the wait staff. It was over the top. Too much attention. Great restaurants know how to service you without making you feel like they are on top of you every 5 minutes. Nuff said.I did find the bartender to be super friendly and warm. And as I said, the actual food was very good. Lobster appetizer is amazing and the meats are excellent. Will go back again but I will warn the waiter in advance to give us some space."

It was very loud.So much so that at a table of 4 we had to scream to hear each other. Not the best combo for a nice dinner. The food was good, but not at the level I was expecting from and ex-Alexander's chef. I've been to Alexander's in Cupertino (many, many times) and while this was great, it was not on their level. I had to ask three to have our water filled up, the noise was out of control, especially with a large group of guys (around 12) yelling and screaming throughout dinner like it was their frat party reunion. Perhaps this was not the fault of the restaurant booking such a party and more on the patrons' behavior."

The menu has good options, execution is good but not great in terms of flavor. I'm a big fan of salt, but most of our dishes had too much even for me. Perhaps the Wague steaks are fantastic but at roughly $200 for the smallest serving I'm unlikely to be trying them unless you are buying. The place was cold when we arrived (early dinner, 7 or so) and the A/C was blowing so hard it seemed like the doors were wide open.... had to wear my jacked for a while. The place is funky inside with round dinning area, super unique."

You're going to pay, but it's a great experience. I brought my own wine. 1st 2 corkage @ $20/bottle. Don't bring just any wine. Look at the wine list and see if you can get it cheaper and bring it in. That's the way to go. Got to see Fmr. Mayor Willie Brown dining in as well."

I dropped almost $300 for two people and have spent half that at other restaurants and had a much better experience. The hostess managing the reservations was a total sourpuss. Our server literally argued with us the whole time about how our experience was going. He was trying to be pleasant but came off as overly aggressive. The hard up sell on the wagyu beef is inappropriate. I know what wagyu beef is. If I wanted it, I would've ordered it. Their wine list leaves A LOT to be desired. The cocktails were good, and the dessert was the best part of the meal. This place is way overrated. Spend your money somewhere else."

For dessert, the L'Opera Verte with green tea and the Fondant Cake are a great way to end the evening. Great service. Leila, was an amazing waitress and was incredibly helpful.

Secondly, the beef was sheared on one side therefore the marbles was cooked and thus it does not melts in your mouth. If it say sashimi it mean raw not shear at all. I rather have the thinly sliced wagyu beef melts in my mouth.2. My guest ordered Medium Rare on the Lamb, it should be medium on the outside and rare in the inside-it turns out that the outside is medium but the inside is also medium. The other steak was ordered rare and the outcome is not rare at all. Fortunately, my was bloody rare and I really liked it."

We were seated by a pillar which feels a bit strange to us, we asked to be seated in the other table, the receptionist told us that will be used as a table for 5 later, but it turned out not, just another couple, I wished she had just told me it was reserved. Now I felt like either she lied to us or she just didn't want to go through the little trouble to walk us 3 more steps to that table."

There were 4 of us dining, and 2 persons decide on splurging on the wagu steak. The other 2 had their filet mignon. The wagu steaks were excellent (although quite an investment) and cooked exactly as ordered. Both of the filets were overcooked. We found that all other dishes we ordered from the daikon soup, to shots, to side dishes were distracting with flavors. The one strong negative note is that the person who greeted you at the door was very \"cold\" - not welcoming. In addition, although Open Table confirmation email advised of 1/2 price bottle of wine on Sunday nights, we had to ask about it, and bill was adjusted."

Having enjoyed their talents several times before, I went with great expectations to try the \"Dine Around Town\" menu. Wow! Caesar salad and carrot ginger soup were ample and delicious. My petite filet, prepared rare as I like it, was 6 ounces of tender, exquisitely flavored beef. My friend had the 8 ounce New York syeak with onion jam and crispy onions which he was unwilling to share! We chose the \"shrooms\" as an extra cost side dish (as the special included none) and could not finish them they were so rich, varied and plentiful. The dessert choices included a small but tasty tapioca brulee and a \"pots de creme\" style, three-layered chocolate. Value++++!"

Although I had already thought about what I wanted to order, the server did a great job explaining the DaT menu and the regular menu. To get the most for our money, my boyfriend ordered the romaine salad with NY strip steak and the chocolate cremeux. I ordered the iceberg salad with filet mignon and tapioca brulee. The iceberg salad, filet mignon and chocolate cremeux were the better options. We also got several small plates: first a short rib, corn, bell pepper shooter, a butternut squash in lychee sauce, french and bacon bread, baby cherry madeleines and pumpkin cubes rolled in sugar. I was worried I wouldn't be full with only 3 courses but the many side dishes sealed the deal!"

I'd been a guest at a birthday party a year or so ago and remembered having a great time. The DAT menu had a nice selection of options and everything we tried was delicious and beautifully presented. Obviously, I was most interested in trying a steak and so chose the filet for my entree. It was perfectly prepared and seasoned. I knew from experience that it would also be alone on the plate, so I sprang for the creamy spinach. It was heavenly. If I get that raise, I'll definitely put going back at the top of my to-do list."

Never asked if we wanted coffee or about meals, doneness of steaks etc. In fact, never came to table after meal was served. Amuse bouche, delicious and very nice touch as was palate cleanser/cookies. Appetizers tasty but truffle fries were soggy, barely warm. NOTHING in our dinner service was above tepid in temperature. Unfortunate because the food was very good (truffled Mac/cheese, green beans) 5 steaks. Steak perfect doneness but barely warm. Very disappointing if you like your food hot. We went on the dine about town deal and spent $75 pp. Would have been a 1st class meal if food served hot!"

Got there early to enjoy their happy hour and started with $5 drinks and appetizers, which are good portions and enough to make a meal out of if you split several plates. There was 5 of us and 3 ordered the New York strip and the other 2 ordered the filet mignon, all off the Dine About Town menu. All the steaks were perfectly cooked, the first course of salads were very large portions and desserts were also very good. We had to order four sides to share since there was no accompaniments to the entrees."

Both stake come out feeling like median, I asked my NY strip to be replaced and boyfriend didn't.The replaced NY strip come out prefect.So I am not sure where the problem is, is either the cooking to too careless or the ordering is not informative.Usually when you go to a stake house or lounge in this case, they should have the knowledge of how the stake(which part of the meat or cut) should be cooked to be enjoyable. The waitress obviously did not care about people who ordered the DAT menu, just quickly write down what we have and off she go. I will not come aga"

They provided us with an amuse bouche complimentary and they added in a birthday treat as part of our meal with a candle.  The food was gorgeous and tasted great.  The only issues were that it took a long time for each meal to come out and it's a bit on the more pricey side for the \"Wagyu\" beef they are known for.  We did have the sliders and they were awesome.  I would come back here for a special occassion."

Also the lobster was over cooked which resulted in a dry and rubbery texture. The steak - Wagyu was excellent! and the sides are heart stoppingly good. Service was attentive and but not suffocating. When you spend this kind of money, you expect consistent and the high standards need to show up the enitre meal."

The food was good, the drinks were fair, the service was rushed, and there was no dining entertainment to entice you to hang out until the Midnight Toast. This was our most expensive dining experience in San Fran, and the most disappointing because of the lack of New Year's Eve experience we're used to. It seems expensive dining was rushed so attention could be given to those who bought \"After Party\" tickets, which was a DJ in a small dance area. Even in D.C. dining establishments do not put you in a vice grip like this. No worries though, our lack of tip reflected our disappointment."

They offered a Prix Fix menu for this holiday. We had very good service - a great balance of being warm and very professional. The food was very good, and beautifully presented. I will say this is the most money I have ever spent on a meal for two, so for me, it is definitely a special occasion restaurant. The food and the ambiance also has a subtle Asian influence, which work, but it is not a classic steakhouse."

They had a prefix menu the food was good however one of the members of our group had to send back the same steak 3 times because it was over cooked. Once that was fixed the food was great. The service on the other hand was sub par they could have had a McDonalds employee do a better job. Also beware the club is immediately behind where the dining area is so it can get very loud which it did and it made the experience not as nice as it could have been."

This restaurant is very expensive and its specialty is wagyu beef/steak - beef that is treated very specially so you get the richest, most flavorful meat that melts in your mouth. Unfortunately, we chose to skip it as it is very expensive. We chose our favorite - prime rib. And it was amazing.This place is for people who frequent high-end restaurants on a regular basis, and probably people who earn six digits at least, and/or people who do a lot of traveling because of their career. We're teachers - as much as we liked this place we probably won't come again."

We enjoyed the vibe, and will return soon! I had the 5A5 and it was dreamy. My boyfriend had the filet mignon and loved it. Excellent quality meats, and I was surprised at how many non-meat choices were on the menu as well (veggies, seafood (we loved the scallop wrapped bacon appetizer)"

The rest of the food is mediocre though. I ordered 4 shooters to start off with. Interesting concept that doesn't really work; most of the ingredients just get stuck in the shot glasses and you can't really \"shoot\" them. The Hamachi shooter was by far the best of the four. The oysters had a funny combination that didn't quite work for me and the lobster shooter had dry over cooked lobster meat, a real let down."

Wagyu is very rich in flavor and melts in your mouth. The waiter, forgot his name, a middle eastern gentleman, older,  really knows the food and explains everything. Really enjoyed this restaurant"

One downside, the kitchen is loud and wide open to the whole Dining room. The Maitre D sat us at the table facing the wide open kitchen (the restaurant had many, many open tables) and was rude to us when we asked to be moved. He visited every table except ours. Lucky us. Food outstanding and the Wait staff was outstanding and all despite the child of a Maitre D/Manager. I recommend it despite him."

If you go, definitely ask for Jade to be your server. We dined on a Sunday evening, so it was not too busy so the noise level was low. The food was very good, but the prices of the entrees and the wine list were unreasonable."

So order it even if you avoid carbs! Staff was friendly and helpful. It was modern and happening. I will go there again."

We couldn't have asked for better food or better service! Thank you to everyone at 5A5 for making our night out special!

Nice surprise was wine was 50% off on Sundays, so was able to choose a great bottle of wine. And side dishes are substantial enough to share with another person. Also, the chef's sent out a variety amuse bouche's between courses for us to try which were very interesting/delicious. I would definitely reserve this restaurant for a special occasion if budget it not an issue."

The marble was so perfect, it literally tasted buttery, but you didn't actually see or trim ANY fat. My first trip here, but certainly not my last! Having said that, what actually made the meal most memorable was our server Erika. Close attention to every detail yet not breathing down your neck and extremely knowledgeable about the menu as well as the wine list. I can assure you, your drinks wont run dry."

Also, we thought the atmosphere/ambience was very odd and the restaurant was also very noisy. The environment was not very conducive to a quiet, romantic date, which is what we were hoping for."

To start we had Lobster Tail Tempura to share, Main dish was boneless Ribeye medium well with marble potatoes and mac & cheese. We also had a bottle of wine because Sundays all the wine bottles are 50% off! So we had a Chardonnay Whispering Angel white wine. We were so full that we had no space for dessert but they gave us the cutest complimantery mini dessert to share that said \"happy anniversary\" on it and we ate it but we were so full haha. But seriously its pricey but a nice romantic place to go to."

The decor is modern and fresh. The menu is diverse and the choices are different than many steak-specialists.The beet salad was excellent; the macaroni and cheese was very tasty and NOT the same old thing you expect. And, as one should expect, the beef was exceptional. Try 5A5!"

Although the food was good and the service was great, it was normal.The chef did supply us with complimentary treats for palette cleansing and other reasons which was nice, and I would recommend going at least once since the other steakhouses in the area are much more expensive and fill up quickly."

It took 30 minutes for drinks to arrive and although the waitress said it would take 40 minutes for the food to come out it ended up taking at least an hour if not more. It felt like long periods of time where no one came to check on us--for either more drinks or how everything was going. Plus that night we had two servers (I had assumed one was being trained), I thought since there were two of them they would be more on top of it. Also, our waitress was so soft spoken we could hardly hear her. I had assumed based on reviews and being a more upscale place that they would be on top of good service and good food--I was completely wrong."

Had the NY Strip, Filet Mignon, iceberg wedge salad, truffle fries, and truffle mac & cheese. Great wine recommended and a yummy martini that had a good pour. Food was perfect, and that is a strong assessment coming from me, I'm very particular. Water glass stayed full, delivery of each course was well timed, knowledgeable server, excellent ambiance. Nice enough to dress up on the right evening but don't have to go all out and can do dressy casual alternatively. Highly recommended"

I had the Kobe beef, or the Australian version, which was great. My date, who was late, again, but only by one minute, had the lamb, which was excellent as well. The butter served with the bread was a much too soft and room temperature, and was quite bland. Might I suggest the excellent butter as at Salt House? It would improve things. Also included was a free hamachi and tofu appetizer that was quite good. And there was also a palate cleanser which was interesting."

The entire place is a big circle and the tables are cut into various parts. You sense you are watching others eat and they are watching you, which isn't the right vibe for a steak place - so that part doesn't really work. Having said that the food is awesome and I think this is a great place to blow out a few hundred bucks on clients, but maybe less often of a date spot."

It's the most expensive item on the menu at $48, andI felt as if I was fighting it the whole time in order to find just a few edible bites.Bread, expensive side dishes and dessert were all delicious, however. There werenumerous \"treats\" from the chef on a slow night, and the server kindly brought anice little birthday cake for my guest on a platter reading \"Happy Birthday,\" which Iappreciated very much."

We were in SanFran for a week of vacation and this was the best meal we had there.  I cannot say enough that this was the best steak I have ever eaten.  The appetizer shooters were incredible!  Service outstanding as well, and \"ahead of any request\" we could have had.  My steak was so good that I asked to tell the cook myself which he appreciated.  Cannot say enough, don't miss this place!"

Most places are afraid to season prime rib and turn out something that has to be slathered in horseradish to avoid having it taste like cardboard. Not true at 5A5.

The service was great, the cocktails were superb but the food unfortunately wasn't anything special. We ordered the truffle fries, monsuni salad (spelling) and the prime rib. The waiter recommended the \"aged\" steaks ($$$) I guess we should of took his advice because the prime rib with peppercorn and mushrooms was bland and chewy. I probably will give it another try since the place has a good vibe to it and the cocktails are spot on."

I loved every bit of my meal (crab soup, halibut, & creme brulee) & so did my hubby (ceaser salad, steak, & chocolate mousse). I would DEFINITELY suggest foodies to check out this place!"

Ambience needs a facelift. This may have been considered \"cool\" in the 80's or 90's but lighting in main dining room needs some updating. Also, the open floor plan to bar & dining area does not help noise level (which was high). Finally, the restaurant was FREEZING so we needed to ask that manager lower air conditioning. Food was otherwise okay. Bacon-wrapped scallops were delish and bone-in rib eye was fabulous. Unfortunately, this is one of those \"been there, done that\" restaurants. For $250.00 for two people, there are a lot of other exciting options"

Food was very good with some eclectic options on the starters and sides. Beef was very good and the Wagyu mix tasty. The non-beef choices were respectable as we had a vegan with us.Wine selection was respectable as guests had differing pov's on Bordeaux Vs Russian River with good options for both sides. Good cocktails and deserts. Service was outstanding with very attentive staff and servers. Highly recommend for business dinner and good meeting spot near financial district and hotels."

The steaks are cooked perfectly , and there's a respectable variety of steak cuts, non steak entrees and sides. Also, cocktail prices are reasonable, the bar won't gouge you.CONS - Service was NOT up to standard for this level of restaurant. They brought out the wrong dishes to us, then came back and brought them to a different table AFTER I had poked the steak (with my finger) and even told the server I had. REALLY??? The server started out great, then dissapeared for 20-25 minutes when we had finished - leaving our empty plates on the table for that whole time.OVERALL - Give 5A5 a whirl if you have the wallet to gamble on the service."

Liked the complimentary samples, and the lime palate cleanser was a nice touch. Service was fantastic, helpful and friendly. Only real downside was the noise. Also they ran out of the Malbec I ordered and the Italian wine (can't remember the name) they recommended instead was not to my liking. But overall a great experience - I will definitely be back."

I became an evangelist for 5A5 encouraging all my friends to patronize it. Unfortunately, my experience the 2nd time, particularly the 3rd time, was very disappointing. The steaks were bland, tough, & frankly speaking inedible. When I told the waiter, he kinda just looked at me, and said okay. Nothing was done to remedy the situation and no attempt was made to satisfy me. I got charged as normal. Something must have happened in the past few months that has caused 5A5's quality to go down. I'm hearing the same from others. I won't go back until I know things have improved. Oh, one more thing, the service is slow"

The alacarte sides were very good especially the truffle fries (which just might be enough to bring me back for fries/starters and a drink at the bar. Service was very good and should be noted server offered to bring us new steaks but there would be a 30mi ute wait for our new steaks and half the party would be sitting there while the others ate."

Maybe it was that good, but I couldn't get past the charred tasted on the outside to enjoy it. I will say that the lobster tempura, beet salad, and maguro shooters were amazing! Go for appetizers and skip the steak."

However, the Bone-In Filet did leave something to be desired. Filets are generally a lean cut of meat, but the bone in Filet seemed to have a significant amount of fat in it. Not marble...fat. Definitely not the quality of meat I would expect at a finer steakhouse. Nevertheless, I would go back and order the filet (no bone), as I did see the cut at an adjacent table. The ambiance of the restaurant was very romantic, and despite the disappointment with the steak, the night was an overall success."

She gave great recommendations because they ended up being what my girlfriend and I had planned to order! Venue was beautiful, food and drinks were delicious, service was awesome, and noise level was kept to a minimum so we were able to enjoy the evening!"

The half price on the wines was very attractive but since I was driving, we could not take advantage of the offer. Where this restaurant lacks is in the food.Chicken Yakitori appetizer seemd like it was warmed over and some Japanese sauce poured over. I had the special, a bone in filet - overcooked and no flavor. My wife had the sea-bass and again, no flavor. Very disappointing. The cheddar cheese potatoes was overcooked."

Then there were wine issues, our steak wasn't cooked the way we wanted it, was mediocre ($68!) & was missing the seared foie gras we ordered. For that price point, it ranks lowest of restaurants we've tried in the city (& that's a lot)."

The choises were great and the portions were just right didn't go home hungry and not super stuffed. And let me tell you this was one of the best steaks I've ever had it was like butter and they was just the regular steak Yumm. I plan on going back just to see the real menu. If you want to treat yourself to SF fine dineing and still be able to have fun wile there then 5A5 is the place to go."

I had made a reservation nearly 6 weeks before, received numerous confirmation calls from the restaurant, and not once was I informed that it would be a prefix menu. It was an upsetting surprise when we sat down for dinner as we had already picked out what we wanted from their regular menu. We had no choice but to pick items from a 4-course menu that we did not care for. Worse yet, considering the price of the dinner, I thought the quality and creativity of the food was mediocre at best. I'd love to go into detail, but there aren't enough characters. The only saving grace was the Wagyu beef, our champagne, and a nice waitress."

The rib eye steak was cooked to perfection but lacked flavor. Everythting else was outstanding and the pre- fix menu was great, but not cheap at $95.00 a person, although it was Valentine Day."

The kitchen fixed it right away. The portions were good and the food was very tasty, especially the barbequed ribs and sea bass. The foie gras was delicious. The bar was very busy and loud so we opted to sit away from the action upstairs. There it was cozy and atmospheric with python printed banquettes and mood lighting. We were each given a dessert on a beautifully decorated plate with Happy Birthday and our names. Not an inexpensive meal but a good dining experience."

It was a Thursday night and the restaurant was filled with a buzz at the bar that reminded us of our NYC dating days. We were given an intimate table that was quiet enough where we could talk yet close enough to the buzz that we still felt like part of the scene. The food was amazing. We were even given a special \"Happy Anniversary\" cake for dessert which was greatly appreciated. I highly recommend 5A5 for any occasion. It is fun and the food is fantastic."

There was no room for both amuse bouche and salads on the table. The servers did not help or try to make room. So some of us barely had a chance to eat the amuse bouche before giving it back to make room for the salads on table. After the salad, there was about 15 minutes gap before the main course arrived. We knew it would take time for the steaks but they could have timed serving of the salads better so it was not rushed at the beginning then with a long wait for the main."

We ended up trading, so it worked out, but it would be nice to have gotten exactly what we wanted. The bacon wrapped scallops were great, too. Also, the pistachio cake was unique.

The chairs were comfortable but the room was rather drafty. Food:The amuse bouche chawanmushi (steamed egg) with crab meat was overly salty.The truffled fries were really good, the iceberg wedge salad was okay but hardly seems 'fine dining' since it's just two hunks of lettuce with some thousand island dressing on top. We had the rib eye steak, which was flavorful, but the texture was more tough than tender. My friend requested rare but the rare looked practically the same as the medium. However, dessert was easily the best part of the meal. Probably will not return."

While there was such a flurry of activity among the staff who were all attentive and accomodating we never once felt rushed or that their presence was an intrusion- what a remarkable balance they have struck. The menu is diverse and the spin on the dishes provides a contemporary and ecclectic menu. If we visit SF again, it would make our to do list for sure."

We also ordered a side of mushrooms, which sounded better on the menu but in the end the exotic medley tasted pretty uniform and a bit too similar to the shiitake on my ribeye. It also came with two types of bread, one studded with bacon, an amuse bouche of chawanmushi, and a palate cleanser. The best part though was the dessert, in particular the multi-layer chocolate mousse cake was amazing, esp. with all the extra bits accompanying it. The pistachio cake was also a pleasant surprise, much better than I expected."

The bar area is very too, with good five dollar drinks and wine. There are also plenty of appetizers and bar food where you can sample the menu to see if you like the place for a fraction of the actual me u price."

Waiter was an \"interrupter\" meaning he would approach the table and start addressing us when we were in the middle of a conversation. He was over attentive and interrupted our conversation several times. Waiters in nice places like this should develop a sense of timing with the customers so that they don't feel interrupted mid-sentence.I was disappointed with the sides, a little plate of mac n cheese and mashed potatoes. $10 each. Simply way too pricey for what you get.The place is pretty, elegant, classy though, but not enough to recommend the place over other restaurants. Sorry."

This was a nice ending to a delicious meal. I was surprised to find that the restaurant served an amuse bouche and an intermezzo even on a DAT menu. They were not skimby;we were served perfect portions at reduced prices. The wait staff was attentive, friendly, and professional. The large dining room was spacious and comfortable. The decor and ambiance were striking. Overall, I was very satisfied and I will definitely return."

We were recommended a 30 oz. Tomahawk Bone in aged Rib Eye. Waiter kept saying it was his favorite. We waited a long time for it so we were expecting it to be very very good.

They make an authentic Caesar salad with Romaine lettuce, Spanish anchovies and excellent dressing. We split both salad and meat, which they willing did, for no extra charge. Some of the starters and side dishes were not to our taste (either a little too salty or too spicy), but they were fresh, and excellently prepared. We were the oldest people, by 20 years, in the restaurant (which was almost completely filled), so our taste for the side dishes may not reflect a younger crowd. I am writing this review because I have seen a lot of negative reviews about the service or the food, and I wanted to add our perspective"

While I will be back, three things kept this from getting more stars:1. Steaks were slightly overcooked (we had a party of 10 and that was a common comment among the group.2. Great sauces but a terrible mistake of pour it all over the meat. The flavor of the steak was lost to showcase the sauce. On the side would have been perfect, it didn't need to swim in it.3. Side dishes were an afterthought, at best. The Au Gratin potatoes where hardened and the three orders on the table where uneaten.They do a lot right but they could benefit with the details."

The waiter Ryan told us the filet is good but ended up with disappointment. Lucky the foie gras tasted okay. We also ordered the Lamb Duo and it came on the table the same way as the Filet, I guess the chef is not on duty today? Totally unsatisfied with the quality and I can't believe I can only get this quality for the price I paid. The only dish I was satisfied that night was the Sashimi Kobe which requires no cooking."

If you're not hungry - hit the bar - their drinks are well worth the prices. The Bramble On & the spiced pear are my top drink suggestions....the bartender really knows how to pour a drink.

The bar staff are friendly and the happy hour deals are solid - highly recommended! We moved onto dinner, which I've had before. Though I've usually gone for the A5 steaks and this time were trying to be more budget conscious. I tried the bone in ribeye. It is ENORMOUS. I could barely finish a quarter of it. The sauce is rich and it's definitely hearty. Had the brussel sprouts, which was a first and the mash with candied bacon, which is a personal favorite. We also had a bottle of wine, which at half price on Monday's is a steal. Daniel the waiter gave a great recommendation on the wine. I'll be back on Mondays!"

For a 150 piece of Wagyu steak, you don't want truffle oil and soy flavors overpowering the meat. The mashed potato side is covered in bacon fat to the point you simply can't taste potato. The kitchen has a very heavy hand with the seasoning that does not allow the expensive ingredients to speak for themselves."

Atmosphere was frenetic. I am just as interested in the dinning experience as the food and this lacked much positive experience. Wonderful desserts. Doubtful return from all of us."

'Hot chocolate and cookies' desert was just odd, far too spicy and out of the four orders for our table, no one really enjoyed it. Appetizers were good but the menu just did not live up to expectations and with so many other steak houses that deliver so much more than this for similar pricing I don't think we would bother with 5A5 again. Service was very good and the setting was very nice but food a big disappointment."

Very chic. Food was top notch, had the strip and the filet. Also, if you have the option, get the fried cheesecake dessert. Doesnt matter how full you are, make room fpr this one, its unreal."

We decided to bring our own wine to dinner with us as the wine list left much to be desired (seems to be a part of the experience or intentional by the owner). They don't even have an espresso machine, so no after dinner cappuccino! The food was great and very tasty so we can't knock that but if you want to be considered the top of our list there needs to be a nice wine pairing followed by an after dinner libation/cappuccino. The bar scene left much to be desired as well with very limited selection on beverages and relying heavily on mixed cocktails to carry the bar. For the price go to Union Square!"

The filet mignon was tasteless and not warm, but the t-bone was pretty good. My bf had a separate table for his birthday because they could not accommodate more than 10 people per table without a $1200 minimum. His table service was very slow and it took almost an hour before the food arrived. As a result, his table received two free entrees, which was good. Everyone agreed that we would probably not come back to eat here again for a meal. However, happy hour drinks and appetizers are definitely worth it and we'll be back for that!"

The foie gras was delicious - interesting, served over ricotta filled crepe drizzled with balsamic reduction and side of poached pears. Delicious. For our main course, we split a 25oz. rib eye. It was perfectly cooked, tasty and tender. We ordered shrooms and creamed corn as sides and they complemented the steak perfectly. The creamed corn had chorizo which added a nice kick. As good as the food was, the service was impeccable. It was our anniversary and we were treated very well. The complimentary choc tort for dessert with \"happy 14th anniversary\" beautifully scrolled on the plate with chocolate was a delightful surprise and a definite bonus. Very classy place."

I had the 6 oz filet mignon(very good) & my husband had the 4 oz Wagya(pricey at $20 an oz).His steak came out well done instead of med rare. We sent the steak back & was advised it would take another 20 minutes to cook a new one. It was very loud & could barely hear each other. The wait staff was great & the manager was very apologetic. For such a high class restaurant we should never have an issue with a $80 steak. But all in all it was a very nice place, would go back for a speacial occasio"

So helpful since it was our first time she took a lot of time explaining the menu and recommending the 'favorites' and what they were known for. You must try the \"shooters\" as a starter - amazing! And the scallop wrapped bacon - just melted in your mouth.For entrees... The best filet mignon ever - with a balsamic reduced reduction. For dessert you must try the fried cheesecake and the 7* chocolate platter - a fantastic choice!! It was worth every penny for dinner."

This required lifting our arms uncomfortably high up to reach the food! WUWT? Our waiter was consulted on this glitch but did not respond."

The buffalo filet was amazing, very tender and flavorful. My wife really enjoyed the bone-in ribeye. The side dishes (mashed potatoes and haricot vert) were delicious and perfectly sized for sharing. Service was outstanding; our server was very attentive and made sure we were well taken care of. Overall, a great place for premium-quality food.

The one thing we did not like was when one of us arrived, they will not seat you at the table even though it was empty at the restaurant and I was only a few mins early, instead they want you to seat by the bar area which you will look weird sitting alone if you dont want to order drink. So, I ended up waiting for my friend outside."

It put more expectation on the flavor of the food we ordered. It was an excellent gamble- the food was outstanding. Adding any kind of condiment would be completely vulgar and uncalled for. Most upscale restaurants in SF either have great service and terrible food or great food and terrible service. 5A5 had great food and service - something that is a rare commodity (like their waygu beef). Hopefully other restaurants in SF take notice. I hope more diners find this gem of a restaurant. I know I would go back there (budget permitting)."

But all the food was delicious, espcially the sides of Mac & cheese, Brussel sprouts, and truffled fries. The wine list is more than fairly priced and the staff well trained and helpful. Our only complaint was that the restaurant advertises valet parking but fails to tell you they do not offer it on Sunday. Otehrwise, a lovely experience all around."

Okay spot to try once just so you can say that you know about things like Wagu and impress your friends, I guess. It reminds me a lot of Ozuma Sushi in Oakland."

The wagyu was excellent (but then again it better be for the price), but the best surprise was the quality and value of the non-steak dishes we ordered, such as the lobster tempura. Service was knowledgeable, observant/attentive and friendly. And you can't go wrong with the 1/2 off wine bottles on Mondays special."

The ambiance is perfect. The service couldn't be better. The waiter was friendly and knowledgeable but not pushy. The food was outstanding not your usual steakhouse offerings. The hostess called us a cab after dinner and kept checking on us until the cab arrived to take us back to our hotel. On our next visit to SF, we will definitely eat at 5A5 again. It would be worth the trip just to go for dinner ; ) ! The prices were reasonable for such excellent food."

Even the half-Aussie, half Wagyu NY was like 'buttah', it melts in your mouth. About the only reason I wld not give this 5 stars was the starter courses came too quickly, while we were still enjoying the sushi shooters. This followed the slight delay even ordering when the server had not even uncorked the wine we brought. Aside from slightly inconsistent service, the place was great; the steaks are worth it."

I was not disappointed at all; from start to finish, my experience at 5A5 exceeded all of my expectations. Our server for the evening Leah or Laila was very patient and explained the menu items very well. We considered her food recommendations and boy it was delish! For apps we ordered truffle fries, tempura lobster and hamachi shots. For our entree we shared a 4oz wagyu and a bone in rib eye. Sides included shrooms and steamed spinach. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone who loves good food! I'm coming back! Oh, and corkage was only $20."

The meat is good, so I would only recommend just to order the steaks and not the other stuffs. The dinning room is also small and it's situated along with the bar/lounge, so the noise level was high."

Letting us get settled with water first and proceeded to fully explain the menu. Best of all she wasn't pushy when we decided to stick with water for our menu and just enjoy the food. Food was excellent and additional au jus for my prime rib was promptly provided when requested. Gave us the check at the correct time without us asking and proceeded to make sure if we needed a taxi or valet service it would be in a timely manner. In our case we had parked nearby so it wasn't necessary. I will be back for our next special occasion."

The short rib plate that I did have was ok but not special. It also contained a large amount of fat on one of my short ribs which was a major turn off. I've been to this retaraunt before and have had some good meals there. But last night was a definate let down. Not sure if I will return."

She didn't even mention the dine about town deal and we had to ask about it. We had a caesar salad and iceberg salad - the iceberg salad on the menu looked like it was going to have blue cheese on it - chunks - but it was blue cheese dressing only - the bacon on the salad was complete gristle. We both had short ribs which were half fat and full of gristle and not at all tender. We had a side of mac and cheese and it tasted like the salt shaker and garlic salt fell into it - too bad because the cheese combo in it would have been good. Dessert was deep fried cheese cake - we didn't like that at all. Sorry."

The steaks come drenched in sauce, the mac n cheese tastes way too much of truffel (which I didn't think was possible), the spinache was bland and the desserts were actually not good. The lime creme brule was way too sweet, amd the 7 degrees of chocolate managed to have a plate full of chocolate yet nothing I'd want to eat. If it was half the price it would still not be a great restaurant, though one would expect less.I should say the service was fantastic."

We ordered the dine about town menu along with two sides and it was not good. The spare ribs had so much fat on them that there was very little meat to enjoy. We ordered two sides Mac n Cheese and the Shrooms. The mac n cheese was good but the shrooms were under cooked. I LOVE dessert and I did not care fore the deep fried cheese cake. The panna cotta tasted great with the lemon sauce but solo it was bland. Overall i was pretty disapointed with this restaurant. What a shame : ("

What shocked me was a group that was in the bar area when I arrived of some women's club and the noise was deafening. It sounded something like the wild bird exhibit at the zoo. I think the management should have addressed the noise before it got out of control for the sake of diners in the restaurant. During dinner (which was excellent) it was almost impossible to hear the other people in my group. I would not consider this restaurant again for a business meeting or at any time that I might want to converse."

The service is absolutely fabulous and while on the expensive side, the food is very good. In addition to the Wagyu and Kobe steaks, they had top grade USDA beef as well as a fairly broad selection of Asian influenced menu items. The bone-in ribeye, which the server will tell you take 35-40 minutes to cook is totally worth the wait. 5 of went together and we ended up sharing our meals so we could all taste the food. It Was well worth it because the food was great."

However, I should note it appears to appeal to a younger crowd & the happy hour menu looked delicious & more affordable."

I wondered if there was a place that served great steak in a more relaxed and contemporary interior. 5A5 is just that. Everything about this place made for a great evening. From our speedy seating by the smiling hostess to our wonderful server Daniel. And then the amazing food- the Himachi shooter was amazing, I had the filet mignon. The mashed potatoes are to die for (bacon on the side as it's good but quite big chunks and sweet). The steak was melt in your mouth good, the sauces great but not overpowering and did I mention the Himachi shooter?! Tuna with avocado and a bunch of flavors served in a shot glass. The perfect appetizer for the perfect meal."

IT. WAS. DELICIOUS. No argument with that. I don't know what it was...the wagyu flavor itself? The sauce? The way it's cooked? Whatever it was, it was the best steak I've ever tasted.

We had the sides of the mashed potatoes with bacon which were awesome and then a side of the mac and cheese also delicious.We had 4 different deserts between the 3 of us. The apple pie was great adn the chocolate 7 ways awesome. I will definitely go back. Always a great meal. Love this place."

Service was very good- I didn't give it excellent as we had a mix up with our order (but it was fixed right away). The steaks and sides were delicious. I didn't care for the mac and cheese- it was overly \"truffled\" in my opinion. But if I liked truffles more I think I would have loved it. The brussel sprouts were amazing. The salads were nothing to write home about but the starters (seared scallops and lobster tempura) were delicious."

I'm hooked. It was delicious! Also got to taste the 50/50 Australian/Kobe steak which was tender and very flavorful. 5A5 helped make it a night to remember!"

We started with the Hamachi Shooters which are bits of Hamachis, scallions, ginger, ponzu sauce in a shoot glass. Next came the delicious mini Kobe burgers.Two on a plate, maybe not enough as a dinner for a guy but definitely enough for a girl. The meat was tender and melted in my mouth. It also came with these yummy fries. The hoisin ribs and chips were delicious. Four good size ribs and the sauce is so good. Smoke salmon squares were great. The were small cubes with a mini, very mini toast. The truffle fries dipped in sriracha aioli is very addicting. Our favorite of the meats... the dry aged bone in NY in truffle sauce was the best.

Maybe the place turns into a night club on the weekends, but it had the feel of a techno lounge in SOMA instead of a fancy steak house. That said, the food was very good. Hamachi shooter was delicious, the mac-and-cheese is a great side and the dry aged bone-in ny was a very generous portion. Our waitress was lovely, gave great recommendations, which was more than I can say about the hostess, who was dismissive and terse with us even though we had a reservation."

The food was excellently prepared and presented well. Service was welcoming, attentative and efficient. Wes was our server and he is knowledgeable about the menu as well as thoughtful to offer getting our car from the valet or calling a taxi after dinner. No, we didn't drink and we took BART but that was a nice personal and thoughtful touch I've not experienced before."

Our waitress tried very hard, but didn't seem to know what fine dining was about. Her food suggestions were very basic. We went with our own picks and enjoyed them thoroughly. We ordered two sides with our steaks. The steak arrived but no sides. We pointed it out to our waitress who was taking an order form the next table. They finally arrived after we finished our steak with no concession. All the time I spotted a manaager who would not catch my eye. I knew he had been watching this as well. The ambience felt moe like an 80's disco lounge."

My dining companion had an octopus salad that tasted only of daikon, and we had a mushroom side dish that was drowned in sherry. When the only good dish is the steak itself, it doesn't give me a reason to want to go back. Ultimately the restaurant was overpriced for the experience."

The dining room is beautifully decorated. The arrangement and lighting makes each table feel like an intimate corner. The food was equal to the ambience. We started with appetizer shooters and edamame with our cocktails. For our main dish we had the Buffalo filet and Australian f1 NY with green beans and brussels sprouts. The asian flavoring of familiar foods was delicious. Meat has never tasted so good. Our waitress was professional, knowledgeable, helpful and fun. She definitely added to the special feel of the evening. We look forward to dining at 5A5 again."

Steaks were cooked PERFECTLY (medium rare filet bone-in and medium 25-oz ribeye) and service was outstanding! We also had a side of Mac-n-Cheese that went well with steaks. Everything we had had just the right amount of flavoring, not too excessive and not too bland. They also have a great happy hour which I also enjoy. But the whole dining experience was gratifying since there aren't too many places left with a combination of great food and service. Thanks for a memorable evening!"

My salad was very salty - I ate it, but would not get it again. Entrees very good. Don't think I would go back simply because there are too many other great places in San Francisco with a better ambiance and food just as good or possibly better for less money. Also, they had a massive event at the bar - with no separation barrier between the diners and bar patrons, you had to shout at your dinner partner in order to have a conversation."

I always order my steak rare, and our server made a big deal that rare at 5A5 is really, really red, which was fine with me. When my steak arrived it was medium rare to medium. I was disappointed but didn't want to complain so I ate it anyway. I should have sent it back, since it wasn't enjoyable at all. Unfortunately, that colored the experience for me. However, the mashed potatoes were AMAZING, the appetizers were good (huge portions!) and the other two steaks were fine. Service was very attentive as well. But I'm still disappointed that my steak was completely overcooked."

We followed that with terrine de foie gra, which was also very good.  Then tried two types of wagyu beef.  As the server promised, the wagyu just melts in your mouth. But for me, not worth the price.  Obviously, if you go to 5A5, you have to eat the wagyu, but at about $19/oz (with a 4 oz minimum), just too pricey.  Corkage was only $20, which is very reasonable so highly recommend bringing your own wine (because the wine list is heavily marked up)."

The dining was the draw for us though. We were seated at a comfortable table and served by a very friendly young waitress. I liked the energy of the place, although it loses a bit of ambiance by keeping the dining area open to the bar - and the double doors in front close slowly allowing cold outside air to draft into the dining room. The food was the standout. I had a 4 oz waygu delicacy and my fiance had 6 oz of bison. We shared the haricot verts and au gratin potatoes, and each had an accompanying glass of wine. Excellent all around (except the $5 happy hour wine - pick a better selection)."

We followed that with filet mignon and T-bone steak, both cooked to medium rare perfection. Couldn't resist trying the mac and cheese (I'd never had it in a restaurant before, but it brought this comfort dish to a whole new level). The service was very professional and the wine list had many choices by the glass. To top off this meal we opted for desserts of fried cheese cake and chocolate 7 ways."

My husband had the lamb chop/sirloin dish - delicious and cooked to perfection. I had the aged NY strip - tender, juicy and cooked to perfection. Order the potatoes au gratin as a side.

The sides were bigger than I had expected--enough for two to share. Mac and Cheese--I found the flavor too overwhelming (made with Gruyere). The Mushroom \"melody\" was perfection. Nicely complimented the steak. I must also mention my starter of Hamachi Shooter--you have to try this--a real celebration for the taste buds!! The razor clam chowder was less than exciting."

Our server was quite congenial, enthusiastic about the menu and offered suggestions and descriptions. I was curious to try the bison but also somewhat reluctant as I'd never sampled that type of beef and was afraid that it might be \"gamy.\" Jim K. assured that it was not, and suggested that I order it rare to medium rare. I brought three friends who'd never been there--needless to say they were mightily impressed. Absoluted loved the presentation and flavor of \"where's the beef.\" The highpoint of my dinner (aside from the Bison--OUTSTANDING BTW) was the 7 degrees of chocolate---whoa! Decadence without the guilt! TY 5A5!!"

Unfortunately, the service didn't match the meal....starting with the wait person in the bar area (by the time the wine and soft drink arrived, our table was ready)....to the dining room staff. We waited for menus, waited for water, waited to order, waited for food. The person clearing the table was truly the most competent. Staff needs training!!Will give it another try!"

The fries were so delicious that even my husband, who normally doesn't venture far from just simple meat and potatoes, ate these up. We shared the Wagyu Trio. We could've easily finished off two platters of these.  The beef was so tender.  It's like they say - \"melted like butter in your mouth\"! We'll be back again some day for another special occasion dinner."

We all had filet mignon, prepared medium rare, which pretty much was the highlight of the dinner. The meat literally melted in the mouth. It came with no sides but it was enough for the ladies. The salads and desserts were just okay. We went on a Thursday and expected a more vibrant scene, thought it was a bit quiet for an ultra lounge. We had lots of cocktails, actually spent more on drinks than food. At the beginning, the waiter spilled a drink all over the table and we assured him that accidents like that do happen. It was just surprising that nothing was offered on the house."

They made sure that it was prepared and served to celebrate this special day but respected the request for discretion. Service was excellent and so was the food although, while it was excellent and well prepared, I would not recommend the Australian \"special F1\" as its price is definitely not justified versus other choice meat found in the USA.We liked the decor but it is obvious that interior decorators and architects working on this project should take a few classes in noise management and control. There are ways and material that could lower the surrounding noise and make the place even better than what it is."

Definitely indulgent considering the bill was well over $300 for four people but well worth it; especially for a special occasion. To try: the b.l.t. scallops, clam chowder, and obviously the STEAK! Maybe someday I'll try the touted Wagyu...The ambiance was nice--not quiet but definitly not loud. They do have a DJ afterhours though and a cool bar."

The squash soup and iceberg lettuce salad were both competent. The New York steak was a bit tough and chewy, and the cheese on top was cold in the middle. The salmon was nicely done, and the filet mignon was good but a very small portion."

The service was impeccable: attentive without being intrusive; dishes well timed, so we didn't feel rushed or like we had to wait forever in between; water always filled; and any food/water spots on the table were very quickly wiped up. We will definitely be back!"

Overall, this place was a good place, though the food was pretty pricey."

The Wagyu beef looks incredibly pricey, but haven't seen any other steakhouse willing to carry and stock such high quality beef. Will definitely save up and splurge next time on Wagyu! Date had the New York strip and strawberries&champagne dessert, both were delicious. Shared two cocktails, the French A5 (like a raspberry bellini) and the paradise something, which was heavy on the Patron, but yummy. Ambiance is wonderful--romantic setting; lots of couples, some groups. The service is fast and immediate (5 people wait your table at a time), empty plates immediately cleared!"

The bar: We hung out at the bar/lounge for 30 minutes before we were seated, which was great. Happy hour lasts until 7:30 pm, so we had the hamachi shooters (try it!) and wine by the glass at the bar - which is 1/2 cheaper than ordering from the table menu.   The meat: We passed on the wagyu, although I was curious. The reviews just don't seem to justify the price. We had the dry aged T bone ($44), bone in rib eye ($43), and filet ($39).  My favorite was the filet.  I thought the T-bone itself was good, but it was too peppercorny for me.  The rib eye was very good.

My waitress was very familiar with the menu and answered all our questions and gave great recommendations for each course. When a guest at my table mentioned she was looking for a private event venue, she found the the coordinator, who subsequently stopped by our table and followed up over the weekend. She also checked on our table regularly without being overbearing or obnoxious. The food is delicious; some of the best cuts of meat in the city! I would highly recommend this to anyone with the caveat that the final bill will be pricey...but well worth it!"

They were out of the japanese a5 at the time but I can't imagine how it could be much betterThe mac 'n' cheese & mashed potatoes were fabulous, a slight hint of truffle in the mac, and large candied bacon bits on the mash-yum!Nice whiskey selection, perused wine menu but stuck with the brown drinks most of the eveningServer was friendly & attentive, can't wait to come back ag"

I thought they were both good, just different. The Lobster Tempura was great but the Edamame was bland and the waiter never brought the salt or soy sauce that we requested to perk it up. I guess he knew he was getting the 18% tip that was automatically added to the bill without warning. That may also be the reason it took three requests to bring our bottle of wine from the bar to our table and why they just laughed it off when they put the wrong name on the complementary birthday desert for my daughter. It kind of ruined what should have been a very special $800 meal."

I didn't have my call returned so I emailed the message through Open Table and asked that they reply soon so we could get a babysitter as needed. They didn't call until the day before, but fortunately it was okay to bring the baby. They even had highchairs. It was just frustrating not hearing back promptly. Once there, the ambiance and service were great. The truffle fries were delicious and the quality of the food was good. The 20 day aged steak was seasoned well, but my husband felt the cut was too thick. My sea bass was good but the sauce was a liitle havy. Overall a good experience."

The decor was very chic, and the clientele definitely matches the ambiance. However, I did not feel like we mattered as much to our waiter as some of the larger groups around us did."

We want to come back with a group and grab a batch of small plates (Asian and Western) and some wine. We'll leave room for the steaks (at least the 4 oz portions). We're not huge red meat people, but when we're in the mood, we want it done right. The variety of cuts, age, beef types, and portions was an unexpected delight. Our steaks were literally perfect in every way. Our waiter, and the service in general, was fantastic.Go deep and splurge or get a tremendous value with a group of friends. Check out 5A5, you'll love it!"

We've been there twice and found that getting a drink or glass of wine takes the longest time of any restaurant we've been to. Not sure if they need more bartenders or what.SA5 appears to encourage noise and they do it well. This is one of the loudest places in town. Even when you sit far away from the bar. The rotunda room has curved walls with hard surfaces that reflect the sound so you can always be sure to hear all the shrieks and shouts and laughs from the bar area. Guaranteed."

Don't miss the tempura lobster (which is perfect without the dipping sauce, BTW) and if you love garlic (like I do) get the macaroni and cheese side with your entr\u00e9e. You'll thank me later."

Also dry aged bone-in ny steak was good, meat itself is so tasty and huge that spinach and mash was absolutely unnecessary. Mash is one of the best 'cos its not over flavored like you find in most places. Definitely will go again and take my friend over for dinner."

I'm not a big mac & chees fan but this mac & cheese will blow you away...ditto on the mashed potatoes. The scallops blt and lobster tempura are a must as well as the hamachi shooters. The steak was incredibly tender, almost like butter. I've been talking about this dinner for two days now! 5A5 you must check out and be willing to spend a little money to really enjoy it to its fullest."

The dry-aged NY strip was a little undercooked for medium rare. It is a great dining location. Would be fit for groups. Our server was scarce, but the water boy was excellent - keeping our glasses full yet being unobtrusive. All in all a good night."

Because we weren't ready when he first came by, our server ignored us although we could see him chatting with different coworkers on a few occasions. Only once we complained to the host did our server become more attentive, but still intrusive. Plus they brought an unordered side dish, instead of one we ordered, that we sent back.

The Truffle fries were good, but after reading so many reviews that they were the best thing ever, I was disappointed...just tasted like good fries. Hubby got oysters, which he said were good and fresh. At our table, hubby ordered an Hamachi Shooter and was very disappointed after reading all the hype. For dinner, we each had a salad and then we ordered one 4oz wagayu ribeye, which was heaven, and an 8oz New York, which was average, to split. Dessert was average, at best. For what we paid, I was disappointed. The restaurant is pretty, but very loud (we went on a weeknight so I am sure it is even worse on weekends). Our server was impeccable!"

The restaurant was alot more quiet and relaxed compared with a Saturday night and had more of a working crowd. It was also half of bottles of wine so we enjoyed a nice reisling.We started with scallops and candied bacon - delightful. My date had a 4oz rib eye and me a 4oz filet mignon, both medium rare. Her rib eye was amazing, slithers of fat that felt like marble on the tongue. My filet was lean and tender, so pick according to your taste. Sides were mash (love it) and spinach (whatever). For dessert, I had red velvet with cheesecake flavored icecream (warm and cold!) and she had smores."

It was cooked to a perfect medium but was surprisingly tough, it did not cut like a Prime piece of beef. One of my friends had the Wagu, which I tasted; it was good but not great. Another person at the table had the buffalo steak, which shockingly was the best piece of meat I tasted all night. The much vaunted mac and cheese side was ok, but again portions were small. Having eaten at Harris the week before its safe to say there is no comparison. If you are in it for the steak go elsewhere, if you want a hipper \"with-it\" destination this my be the place for you."

The food was good (except for the prime rib) and the decor is still fun, not having changed much from Frisee. Our waiter knew his steaks and our bartendress was a hoot, as we stayed after for cocktails. My only complaint was smoke that kept wafting by our table. We were in the back near what we thought was a back door but someone mentioned there may be a smoking lounge in the back. That would be unfortunate as it may infuse others' meals with that stench when they eat as well. I'll cross my fingers it's just a back door and hope someone was just smoking outside."

The quality is always excellent, the service very nice -always some guys warmer than others, but always very professional- The appetizers are outstanding for quality and presence. The Foie-Gras is out-of-this-word! I always have it, whatever else... the Sashimi, even the Truffle fries! Meat is the strong point, yet my favorite are the dryaged. excellent price-quality balance. and the great surprise: The sides! I never take sides normally... here they're a whole dish and a whole experience :) don't miss the Portobello! Enjoy! Only one issue: I always go during the week. Yesterday was Friday, very busy and energetic."

That said, steaks are excellent, though a bit heavily sauced. The Australian F1 was not worth the price, but the filet mignon, NY strip (amazing truffle butter), and bone-in rib-eye were. The sides (mac 'n cheese, potato gratin) were delicious. Oyster and hamachi shooters to start, both very good. Red velvet dessert was a nice finish; the french toast dessert tasted of old fried oil and wasn't palatable. Though I could see that our table was ready, the host said it would be 10 minutes & directed us to the bar, an obvious attempt to make us purchase drinks there. I would visit again."

The atmosphere was very comfortable, modern, and pleasing to the eye. Food was superb! Best starters: the truffle fries & scallops! The sides, baby bok choy and mac & cheese, were perfect for our steaks. One slight criticism was that the steaks seemed to be a little more medium-well than medium. But, the taste was fine and still thoroughly enjoyable. The cocktail drinks are fabulous! The desserts were excellent. The Breakfast After Dark (French toast) was the best! I will definitely come back to try more food & drinks. I love the bar and the lounge setting. This would be a perfect place to have a small party."

My server explained to me that Japanese A5 beef is currently very difficult to get, as it is not being exported from Japan; and they they have the comperable Cabassi and Rea black label beef from Australlia. Should have been changed on their website. I called over a manager who was very polite, and gave me the same explanation. He did however insist that their website had been updated with their current menu. Once seeing that it had not been changed he apologized over and over. For the inconvenience he comped our sides, three desserts, and a bottle of port. CLASSY, Overall food A"

However, when we arrived at the restaurant, the host insisted that our reservations were at 5:45 rather than the 7:15pm that was on my Open Table confirmation. This was strange since the restaurant called me the day before to confirm the reservation. The host was a bit rude and insisted that it was not his fault. They ultimately seated us but not without a bit of drama. Given this, the overall experience was not as good as it should have been."

The Wagyu rib eye steak main course was excellent. Probably the best beef that I have ever eaten. The seasoning and sauce was a perfect match for the meat that melted in your mouth. Of course, it has to be medium rare to maintain that heavenly texture... Portabella and Bok Choy side dishes were good but not great. Dessert was also good but not great. Otherwise this would have been a five star dining experience. It's one of those \"every now and then places\" just for special occasions, otherwise you'll need to work extra hard or hit the lotto to make this place a habit... and have a cardiologist on speed dial"

The place specialized in meat and steak. So I choose the buffalo filet, and my partner chose Australian sea filet (I think that what it called). Both steak is so tender and juicy. Do also try the lobster tempura.. It was so crispy yet moist.. last we have Peach & Cream for dessert, and it was awesome. The hemechi shots were great also. Dinner for two come out to two hundreds dollar. It was a nice experience. I would go back if there another opportunity."

There are several Japanese beef selections which are interesting if spending $145 for an entree seems a good value. However, if you are looking for a traditional steak house meal, this is not the place. The prime rib, while tender and well cooked, was served in thin slices; baked potatoes are not offered, there was only one non-ceasar green salad.This place is the definition of trendy- the salad plates are narrow rectangles-which makes eating lettuce a real challenge. There is a large bar but if you want a mixed drink stick to those on the menu- anything else isn't available. Eating here was like dining at your mother's- good food but she chooses it."

The service is always over the top, best reason to go there (if they can hear you). Love the decor and it is a very comfortable place to have dinner. Even if you don't eat beef, plenty of delicious fish and sushi on the menu...and the sides are delicious. I was little disapointed in the chocolate dessert (what's with the powder?) but loved the Red Velvet cake."

The wine was half off the bottle, (special for Mondays), which was a really good deal. Overall, a great dining experience!"

The server, Wes, was not as pleasant as he could have been. He seemed very rigid and unwelcoming. He really needs to loosen up and show EACH and EVERY customer the same care. We honestly felt judged due to our appearance, which is quite sad in this day and age. We tipped over 20% still because we enjoyed our runner and Jason. If it wasn't for those two, I would have given 1 star for service."

Amazing.I ordered the hamachi shooter without avocado. I think that they may have had to make it from stratch for me. When they did, the sauce was so hot that my mouth was on fire for five minutes. My husband got the regular one with the avocado and his wasn't hot at all, so I think that it was just bad measuring. They were very nice and replaced it with another shooter, which was delcious.Other than that unfortunate experience, I found the food to be delicable and the service terrific.It was very noisy there, so be prepared for that."

The menu is definitely recognizable w/ classic cuts of meat but it's also contemporary & eclectic. The food, amazing. The service, 1st rate and the vibe is so welcoming. In a city that so often pats itself on the back for its diversity of ethnicities, it's so refreshing to actually experieince it in a Financial District restaurant. Patrons and staff alike. I took my brother there to celebrate his birthday and it was great. The team @ 5A5 is so attentive. It was an over-the-top evening!"

Of course the wagyu plates are phenomenal, but their other steaks are also very well-prepared and flavorful. We have tried every steak place in the city and nothing else comes close. They have tasty side dishes that fall in the creative category (excellent uni shooters) as well as side dishes that are familiar but elevated, such as Mac n cheese. The wine list is surprisingly good and reasonably priced. An added bonus is the menu of creatively delicious desserts. The service: as always, gracious, welcoming, friendly. Definitely a gourmet experience worth every penny. Certainly easier than flying to Japan for this caliber of steak."

The sides were delicious -- the bok choy had decadent pork belly bits and the scalloped potatoes were firm and cheesey. A thoughtful custom birthday cake dessert topped a perfect evening. I'm coming back for the cocktails and truffle fries as well."

Delicious tasting meat but the sauces on top smothered it more than I would have liked. Ask for it more rare than you'd like because it comes sadly overcooked. Our server was attentive and very friendly. Sides of mash potatoes (w/ big chunks of bacon), mac and cheese (greasy but tasty), started with truffle oil fries and 2 sets of shooters (those were pretty good). Tasty meal but was it worth $26/ounce for A5? Eh, worth a try at least once in your life. :) I actually liked the steaks at Lark Creek Steak better but this was worth trying."

I would highly recommend this restaurant for any occasion!! Please ask to be sitted in Ali's section, our waiter was attentive, patient, and very funny!! He had made our evening fun with his vibrant personality and wit!"

However, my T-bone steak was chewy and drenched in peppercorn sauce that I could not taste the meat--just pepper. It was like \"where's the beef ?\" My friend had a the bone-in fillet with a lighter sauce and enjoyed it better. Desert was very good (we had peanut butter cheesecake with raspberry and chocolate sauce). Over all a good experience. Food is good not excellent and not a good value overall as the meat entree did not come with any side dishes."

The chef sent over the lobster tempura immediately because of the long wait which we all thought was sweet. We had the sliders as an appetizer and they were amazing! I had the ceaser salad to start and it blew me away. So refreshing! My only complaint for the whole night was that it seemed like we were in a club eating a filet & a nice bottle of wine. The music would have been WAY too intense if we would have brought anyone over the age of 30. For us, it was an adventure, not typical of a steak house but the food was amazing."

My only real issue is the noise as it was way too noisy for enjoyable dinner so beware. This restaurant has a Miami ffeel in SF...overall an enjoyable noisy night out on the town."

However, me and someone came for a nice romantic heart warming dinner, the music is more of a rave and dance techno so not much of a romantic mood setting for us. We started arguing during first course. Personally I would not return to this restaurant for personal reason, but I would definately recommend to my friends."

At the price level here, many other San Francisco restaurants offer food with more imagination and dining rooms that are more festive or special. Also, the menu choices here are EXTREMELY limited. Basically, I can't complain about the food or service but this restaurant is boring---if you're trying to impress a client or going out for a special occasion, go elsewhere."

Boy was I wrong. We arrived early and had a drink at the bar. Nice bar with good bar food options and tasty cocktails. Next time when we are looking for after work drinks and finger food this will be the place to go. Then we had dinner. I had a hamachi shooter which was fantastic. I could have had a donzen to eat. Then the buffalo filet which was cooked to perfection. For a cut of meat that is lean they did a nice job. Finally, we shared the mac & cheese, which I thought was one of the best I ever had. When we left we both agreed we were pleasantly surprised!"

Not only did I eat here, but I was just about to write about how amazing the steak sammie is. Had they been busy, not even worth mentioning. However, it is mildly annoying that when only 4 tables were being used, it was not possible to correctly click on my name on their computer so I was officially \"present\" for opentable purposes. But, I will say when I called, the problem was quickly fixed.Now, the steak sandwich: WORTH mentioning. Heaven on a roll. Such a lovely lunch menu - just the right combination of steak/potato fare and posh but tasty staples. Service was fast an attentive, though again, they were not busy, so I cannot speak to wha"

Food-kobe burgers cooked as requested; nice meat flavor-almost too rich tasting; onion rings looked great; bland flavor; chicken sandwich was reportedly good enough. Specialty non-alcohol nojitos were delish; no time left for dessert-lunch was also hitting 2-hr mark. Our waiter appeared to be able to focus on one table at a time - we had a good 40 min wait to place our orders. He just never came by. Food did not take long to prepare; nice size portions"

Arrived during the end of Happy Hour and the large crowd raised the noise level throughout the restaurant. First Course: Iceburg Salad (similar to a Wedge Salad). I think that the large chunks of bacon should have been finely cut. Excellent blue cheese dressing. Main Course: Medium rare Beef Fillet. Nice crust but interior was partially rare. Slightly sweet sauce added nothing to an otherwise nice cut of beef. Dessert: Ice Cream Torte was well prepared. Not overly sweet or heavy and crust remained crunchy rather than soggy. Gin Martini was properly prepared and served. Mohito had a bitter aftertaste probably due to the mint."

It is almost like they are taking themselves too seriously and it is just not all that it says it is. I will say that the NY steak with truffle butter that we ordered was delicious, but I was unimpressed with the service overall, our 2nd course of seared scallops took more than 30 minutes, and they didn't have a couple of the bottle of wines that we wanted to order."

However, it is an energetic place where there is a vibrant atmosphere so there's alot of animated chatter that can overwhelm your own conversation. Our waiter was incredibly hospitable and allowed my date and I to take our time in conversation as well as make suggestions to us on the menu. We both ordered the Caesar Salad with anchovies and 6oz filet mignon. We also added some side dishes to go with the filet mignon, which were the mushrooms and the cheesy mash. Filet mignon was heaven and I'll definitely go back for more. The cheesy mash was also delightful with bits of bacon in it. We're planning on going back again soon!"

The steaks we had were cooked to perfection - medium rare. The Bok Choy was fresh and prepared perfectly. Our dessert was great a Peanut Butter souffle with chocolate - it had home made butterfingers that were amazing. The service was OK - it started great and finished great, but we had long stretches of being ignored as the place was surprisingly busy for a holiday weekend, they seemed to be staffed OK - but rush hour was a bit much. With that said our server was very nice and very professional."

Service was perfect, gracious, helpful, it seemed like our waitress was there whenever we needed her, and only then. It is quite expensive, but worth it (for special occasions)."

The concept is great but the execution was lacking. The sashimi \"bites\" were underseasoned and there was so little sauce on each piece that overall it was bland. The lobster bisque was too watery; a little cream and salt and it would have been perfect. The macaroni and cheese contained such an over amount of truffle oil (not mentioned on the menu description) that we couldn't eat it and it was not removed from our bill though the waitress apologized. The salmon entree was passable; the tofu cake was good but the salmon skin was soggy and unappetizing. Desserts were good."

My experience: My steak was good, tasty, and cooked correctly (and handled correctly). Mashed Potato side, as recommended by my server, very so/so. wouldn't reorder them. Had the lobster bisque for a starter, pretty good. Ok - so food was good (not Morton's good but better than average). Ambiance: the place is a bit confused and maybe tries a bit too hard. Let the food and the bar speak for themselves. The vibe and customers will follow. Service: This was the gaping hole. I couldn't finish one dish without being clobbered over the head with the next dish. staff needs to relax and give me a good experience."

My boyfriend had the oyster shooter, which he said has the typical sour/acidic taste, nothing special. We also tried the truffle fries which was good because they were crispy and hot out of the fryer. The spicy sauce also tasted good with the fries. There's no actual truffles in the fries...it might just refer to the shape. Both of us ordered filet migon, but mine was the 4oz. wagyu dish. It was very soft and tender, but not the softest steak that I have ever tried. You are better off ordering the regular filet mignon. The matcha donut dessert with peach tea oolong ice cream was pretty good and different...try it! =)"

Salads need a rethink, generally underdressed, strangely balanced and lacking in flavor. Shooters were mediocre with clever ideas like pressed watermelon, but suffered from poor prep/cut sizes. Table service was excellent but marred by a seemingly very poorly trained sommelier (wine list admittedly doesn't help him out here much) who kept pushing \"his special\" bottles that clearly as described and after opening just didnt match what we were asking for, and didnt match well to the food. Felt like we were in Las Vegas - a glitzy, expensive but far from sophisticated experience."

The appetizers came out quickly but once the resteraunt filled up, we were basically ignored by our friendly server, he never came back to check on us, refresh drinks or even serve our food. Slow service after that. The food was very good, everyone loved their steaks and the truffle fries are a must. I had the NY sirloin and it was delicious, very satisfying. I loved the spinach and bok choy sides and my Cosmopolitan was well made. My boss ate the bone in ribeye and it was a huge portion and cooked to perfection. The winos ordered Frank's Family Cabernet, which was delicious. I would go back for the food."

Our server's knowledge of the menu was impressive and was a real highlight of the dinner.Only negative comment (but its a big one for me) is that this place must turn into a nightclub at night or something because there were large nightlcub speakers sitting by our table. They weren't on of course, but when you spend that kind of money ($250 for two) you don't want to see some giant concert-grade speaker sitting on the floor. Also, the hostesses were a bit too young and chatty with eachother and did not make for a good first impression. I felt like we interupted their gossiping when we walked in.But back to the good stuff- the food: AMAZING."

They push the A5 steaks (of course) but the regular steaks were good, but not the best I've had. We got iceberg salad, mac n cheese and mashed potatoes. Like my husband says, you can't really mess up when you throw bacon on everything. Overall, go for the retro vibe and decent food, but not if you're looking for a top steakhouse."

I understand that the meat is allowed to rest, I don't think it translates into a savory meal. Not sure why side dishes like Mac N Cheese were not hot only warm. All meats were served with a demi glace, while tasty, it didn't allow the flavor of the meat to shine. There were several great buys on the wine list, which is nice to see in a high end restaurant such as this."

The ceaser salad was perfect and I loved the pieces of anchovie, my new york steak was perfectly cooked and the sauce it was laid in definately added to each bite. The only food issue was that the filet mignon my date ordered, it appeared to be a little over cooked. The banana creme tart was declious!

The service was great although the waitress brought out a 6 oz steak instead of a 10oz steak and didn't realize her mistake and she also poured the wrong wine into someone's wine glass. However, she was very nice and very attentive. The busboy refilled the water promptly. The wine was great.I did not like my steak. It was small. I understand that high quality steak is expensive and I am ok with a small steak for an expensive price. The problem was that I did not like having multiple sauces, pesto and ginger drizzled all over my steak. A $40+ steak should be delicious with no additives to mask the flavor. The mushroom were chewy."

I ordered the beef medium rare. It was tasty w/the dressing (avocado and pickled ginger?), but more on the rare side and tough to cut. Neither of us finished dessert. I had the lemon custard tart. The crust was cold so I couldn't break it w/my spoon and had to use a fork. She had the bread pudding which was tasty, but very sweet which is why she didn't finish it.The service was polite and efficient. I think it was supposed to be jazz music because it was Mon, but I only heard that kind of club/electronic stuff in the background. Comfortable seating and warmly decorated for a trendy place."

You can specify the size of your steak when you place order. The beef tartar shooter was great. The bread pudding was excellent.The most disappointing is the service. Our server is young and very inexperience. She was a bit nervus, totally not engaging and got a few things wrong."

Very noisy, tables are round and wide making it extremely difficult to hear what is being said directly across from you. Be prepared to lean forward the duration of your meal and speak loudly."

The presentation of the food was also very pleasing to the eye. There were a total of 7 dishes that were ordered and each one tasted great; in comparison to \"good dining\", the flavors of the food at 5A5 steak lounge do not compare, at all. It's almost a sin to categorize 5A5 as a regular \"nice restaurant\", this place deserves it's own category. It's made me look at steak so differently, and nothing compares to the taste of the steak I had here."

The chef needs to gain an understanding of seasonings and taste the food before you serve it. The meat selections for the Dine Around was good because it gave us a chance to sample some of the food. The salmon was flaky but again no taste to it. The desserts frankly were really bad. I could tell that 5A5 has no pastry chef because the desserts tasted and looked as if, someone else made the tiny plain desserts and a sous chef stuck on a plate. Another negative was despite the fact they had a full bar, they had no iced tea and the lemonade which came in a small tumbler was $4 with no refills."

The service was lacking for the price that I was paying to dine, but the food was amazing. Everything was cooked to perfection except for the red velvet souffle, which I'd rather just eat the cupcake, but nice try. Overall I highly recommend this place for meat eaters, special occasions, or just to self-indulge."

The ribeye was massive and cooked (or i should say, not cooked - i ordered it black and blue) to perfection.

After he ended his call he assisted us. My first visit last week, I experienced the same treatment. I asked my girlfriend if she noticed anything as we walked in the door. (I said nothing) She said, \"there was no there to assist us\" I'm not going to comment any further on my experience. I won't return unless someone else is paying or making the reservation.

We were celebrating our wedding anniversary and 5A5 greeted us with a complementary glass of champagne and it only got better from there. The lobster tempura, buffalo filet and bone-in NY were cooked to perfection!! We couldn't believe the creativity and attention to detail the chef had in creating the dishes. Dessert was incredible. We had the donoughts and the bread pudding. Again, spectacular! The vanilla salt on the ice cream was a surprising taste and very enjoyable. We will be back!!"

The whole ambiance of the place is perfect, the inner decor is simple, trendy and classy, definitely a great venue to have dinner or even just have a drink.My friend enjoyed it and she's coming back with her co-workers for a holiday get-together. I would recommend anyone who is looking for a great steak dinner in an upscale/ trendy place.By the way ask for Jim (he's your dream waiter. Empeccable service, personality and attentive)."

My seabass had an exquisitely crisp exterior, yet moist almost creamy inside. Best mac n cheese. Save room for the green tea donuts, so freshly made and light tasting, served warm. friendly, attentive service."

It is unlikely that we'll go back as there are other places in SF where you can spend less for just as good of an experience, this was $100.00 per person. It was interesting to watch diners being seated too, two table were seated and asked to be moved to other tables, one table came in, was seated and then left. Perhaps their feng shui needs to be worked on. Our server Jim was very good and helpful."

You can go for the quality beef dishes in the $20 - $40 range and have an amazing time, or the $275 Japanese Wagyu that is just beyond this world. If you love what is offered at Alexander Steakhouse, the Wagyu here is very comparable. The only suggestion I'd make is that there does not need to be much additional ingredients or condiments to go with the Wagyu. The meat is already rich. To have dripping butter and saucy mini sides with ribcap, for example, may over \"enrich\" the taste and experience. Service was top notch. \"Alena\" made it perfect."

The service was impeccable and our server was very helpful with suggestions. The extensive wines by the glass list was impressive and appreciated if you do not want to buy a full bottle of wine. As expected, they are known for their steaks and they did not disappoint. The Mac-n-cheese was perfect, not too trendy, but definitely steps above the blue box. Please be sure to try the doughnuts for dessert, the best."

Instead of sitting us in a corner of the restaurant, they sat us between a very loud bachelorette party of 15 girls and another noisy table/large group on the other side. It is too bad that this created such a bad experience for us because the food was excellent."

The food was absolutely exceptional (the A5 grade steak is well worth the visit to this restaurant), the service was extremely good, the staff was super friendly & I enjoyed the scenery & ambiance of the restaurant. At the end of the night our waiter brought out a desert plate with my name & Happy Bday on it, that was super thoughtful. I will definitely visit this restaurant whenever I visit San Francisco again! I wish we had one in Chicago, IL...."

I had the regular 10oz filet mignon, not the A5,was cooked to my liking: just red enough and tender on the inside and a bit seared on the outside. My other friend ordered the 8oz Australian F1 kobe steak and thought it was very tender as well. The lobster tempura appetizer was just out of this world! The doughnuts served with ice cream reminded me of Malasada's in that it was warm, fresh, soft and not overly sweet. Everything was fresh! We came on a Thursday night so it wasn't too crowded or noisy. The DJ was spinning cool lounge music so it added to the ambiance. Our waiter seemed knowledgeable and provided great service. The manager visited us and ensured we were taken care of, nice touch."

The place was pretty empty (only about 3-4 other tables were being served), which could have contributed to our exceptional service. We got the bone in ribeye and the mac n cheese, both were excellent! They cooked the steak perfectly (med rare) and the flavor was just what we liked - - just salt and pepper (you could get this bbq-like sauce on the side, but it's more of a hoisin sauce flavor.) The prices were comparable to any other steak house in this price category. The ambiance is really unique - - not the old school steak house with a bunch of old men sitting around. There's a lot of variety on the menu, so we'd definitely go back."

The truffle fries are ok, but lacked taste like most items on the menu. We had a nice bottle of wine. Service was good. The steaks were the biggest disappointment. We ordered a rare bone-in ribeye that was served medium rare. It was dry and tasteless. The two gentlemen who ordered the ribeyes only managed to finish half of it and did not want to bring the rest home. The rare filet mignon also came medium rare served with a thick sauce that was just salty. My friend's Australian F1 was good. The beet salad was ok, but lacked any flavour.The Mac and Cheese was fabulous! That was the best part of our meal!"

I liked the restaurant design, it reminded me of NYC, very modern and cool. But it was WAY TOO loud for a romantic meal. Our waiter was very nice and attentive for the most part (minus a small lapse re: wine). As with most current trends we found the sides and small plates outshined our entres. The Snap Pea soup with dungeness crab was amazing (and I don't normally like pea soup) as were the truffled fries. While I couldn't justify the Kobe, I did get the T-Bone. There's no way that it was ever 22oz. The flavor was good, but not as good as the steak I cook at home."

All of our steaks - and we tried four different cuts - were first rate and perfectly prepared. Spring for at least one plate of the A5 Waygu even if it's just for comparison. It's buttery and has a fabulous finish. But the bone-in New York was equally excellent for some had a better mouth-feel. The service was terrific and although the room wasn't really to our taste they are obviously going for something a little different. My only complaint would be the wine list which was highly priced and unimaginative. There's really no excuse for that in the Bay Area."

Not sure I\"d want to be opening a high-priced steak restaurant in these times.)Menu is definitely pricey - not just the Wagyu items. Food very tasty. Service very strong and attentive - though we didn't really need to server practically reading the entire menu to us, since both me and my dinner partner can read well enough.I've eaten at both Craft and Craftsteak in NY. 5A5 seems like it's shooting for something similar. Not quite there, but I'm crossing my fingers.New, expensive restaurant on a Mon night meant it was pretty slow. That's kind of a buzz-kill, but I can imagine the vibe would be great on a weekend night."

We did enjoy the hip decor and friendly staff, but I guess those would be the only two things we enjoyed. Husband did complain a bit, said rather going to Morton's again for that night (which was celebration in advance for my birthday). It would be more money worth. They have different high quality steaks shown on menu for your choices (cost USD16 to USD19 per oz), supposed they should know a lot about how to make good food. It was kind of disappointed.We will never go to A5A again."

Tried to ask the bus person for some help and I think the language barrier was a problem. I don't speak Spanish that well and he was not really wanting to listen to my request for lemon slices for the delicious King Crab legs. Got to have them.

A huge, sublime T-bone ($35) deserves special mention. Side dishes ($8) were equally bountiful. (We seemed to graze all night on to-die-for truffle fries.) Beet salad and iceberg appetizers were more fussy, but still gratifying. The wine list, although slightly thin, yielded a splendid Spanish ($56). Let 5A5's not-just-gorgeous sommelier introduce you. (Seriously, he's a must.) Dessert menu was however vexing. Overall, I'd like to compliment the owner/managers on an excellent crew, as we met several in the course of our dinner.

Regular steaks were really good, but the A5 ones were the best steaks i've ever had - they just melted in our mouth (our group ordered four different A5 steaks - my fav was the New York). Wife really liked the Sea Bass (at a steakhouse?) and beet salad.Hamachi shooters were really tasty, although a little difficult to 'shoot'. Truffle fries and mac 'n' cheese are out of this world. The A5 is expensive but worth it, other items on menu were very reasonably priced. Desserts ranged from ok - really good, apple tart was the best. Creme brulee was eh.Definitely not a regular steakhouse with its trendy decor, but our group loved it!"

Excellent steaks, perfectly cooked, tasty cocktails and terrific service. That's all good, and what I expected, the bonus is the decor & ambiance. Who doesn't enjoy an good old school steakhouse, but it's nice to see a twist on the tradition. I'll be sending a lot of people there, if only because it seems like the steakhouse San Francisco deserves."

            "Review": "Wagyu A5 steaks are amazing - tiny nodules of fatty flavors popping in mouth with every bite. Warm apple tart is a must have. Mushroom side dish is a great compliment to the steaks. Kobe NY was a total disappointment - that's even b4 trying out the A5. Need more appetizers - only have hamachi and soup shots. Entres are too small to share. Need bigger wine list and more full bodied reds to pair with super rich A5 steaks."
